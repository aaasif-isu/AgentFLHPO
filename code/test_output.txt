>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 3
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 3] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that the client is from a low-resource cluster and this is the client's first training round, the chosen hyperparameters need to be conservative to ensure stability during training. The learning rate is set to a lower value of 0.001 to prevent drastic updates to the model parameters, ensuring stable convergence. For weight decay, a small value of 1e-05 is selected to avoid overfitting while still maintaining the capability to learn. Since this client is weak in resources, a batch size of 16 is chosen to allow the model to train with limited computational load. Due to these constraints, only 1 local epoch is chosen, which is suitable for such clients. The dropout rate is set to 0.1 as a moderate value, providing some regularization without being excessive. The optimizer is set to AdamW, a robust choice that generally performs well and requires less fine-tuning compared to SGD. The scheduler is chosen to be None since the initial round does not have prior knowledge to modify the learning rate dynamically yet.

On the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 is selected. This balances complexity of the deeper layers of the model while being cautious of rapid changes. The SGD optimizer is chosen for potentially better generalization in this case, especially for the complex architecture. A momentum of 0.9 is used to accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, which can help with convergence. Lastly, the StepLR scheduler is chosen to adjust the learning rate after a fixed number of epochs once the training progresses.

Finally, the FedProx regularization parameter, mu, is set to a low value of 0.01. This allows for effective learning while adding a small regularization term to help stabilize the training process across the federated setup.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 23
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 23] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the initial round for Client 23, it is crucial to start with conservative hyperparameters to ensure stable training due to the low-resource nature of this client. The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a common starting point that is neither too aggressive nor too lenient. The weight decay is chosen at 1e-05 to introduce a bit of regularization without overwhelming the model, and the momentum is set at 0.9, providing a good balance between speed and stability in the updates. The 'AdamW' optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be beneficial for training on a potentially small dataset like MNIST. The scheduler is set to 'None' to avoid unnecessary complexity in adjustment during the first round. The number of local epochs remains at 1, as per the constraints, and a batch size of 16 is chosen to accommodate the client's low-resource configuration while still enabling effective gradient updates. The dropout rate is conservatively set at 0.1 to help prevent overfitting without significantly impacting the learning process.

On the server side, given that the server will handle the remaining layers of a ResNet18 model, the learning rate is set to 0.005 to allow for reasonably aggressive yet controlled learning given the structural complexity. A momentum of 0.9 remains consistent for effective training dynamics. The 'SGD' optimizer is selected as it typically performs well in model fine-tuning scenarios, especially for deeper models. A 'StepLR' scheduler is employed to adjust the learning rate at fixed intervals, which may help stabilize the learning process as the training progresses and prevent overfitting. The regularization parameter 'mu' for FedProx is set to 0.01 to introduce a moderate level of control to balance the local updates and the global model aggregation.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 17] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 17 is in a low-resource cluster, the hyperparameters must ensure stability during training. A smaller learning rate of 0.001 is chosen, as it balances effective learning with stability. A weight decay of 1e-05 will help in regularization without overly constraining the model's learning capacity. The momentum is set to 0.9 to maintain a balance between the past gradients and current gradients for smooth convergence while still accommodating the low-resource nature of the client. The optimizer chosen is AdamW, which is adaptive and tends to work well for clients with less computational power. The batch size is kept low at 16, consistent with the need for resource efficiency, and the number of local epochs is set to 1 to minimize computational load. A dropout rate of 0.1 is selected to reduce overfitting risks, as the client is also handling a low-capacity model. For the server, a learning rate of 0.005 is proposed, balancing effective learning in its three remaining layers. The momentum is kept at 0.9 to maintain consistency between current and past gradients. The optimizer chosen is SGD, which is generally effective for more complex models, reinforcing convergence. The scheduler is set to StepLR, as it can adaptively adjust the learning rate, supporting the deeper architecture of the server. Finally, a value of 0.01 for mu will serve to maintain a stable balance between the local and global model updates, taking the first round's information into account.

  Client 17, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 96.83%, Test Acc 63.76%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 1
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 1] ---
  - Reasoning: In this scenario, we have a low-resource client that needs to be tuned carefully to achieve stable training. Based on the peer histories and the context, the following choices have been made:

1. **Learning Rate**: I've chosen `0.001` as it is a standard choice for training with AdamW and has been successfully used by Client 3 and Client 17. Lower learning rates are often more suitable for low-resource clients as they prevent divergence during training.

2. **Weight Decay**: `5e-05` was effective for one of the peers, specifically Client 24, which achieved notable accuracy. Weight decay helps regularize the model and is reasonable for our context.

3. **Momentum**: I selected `0.9`, as it is a common choice that supports faster convergence aided by the use of AdamW.

4. **Optimizer**: The choice of `AdamW` is consistent across the successful peers and is generally robust for convolutional networks like ResNet18, providing a good optimization ability while adjusting learning rates.

5. **Scheduler**: I opted for `None`. This avoids complications from learning rate scheduling, which may not be ideal for a low-resource client with limited computation time.

6. **Local Epochs**: Set to `1` since the only available option is `1`. This provides a balance between local computation and the need for updates to be sent to the server promptly.

7. **Batch Size**: I chose `16`, which is on the lower end to accommodate the limitations of the client while still allowing a reasonable number of samples per update.

8. **Dropout Rate**: Set to `0.1`. This is a moderate dropout that can help prevent overfitting without excessively introducing noise into the training process.

For the server configuration, I have set:
1. **Learning Rate**: to `0.001`. A safe choice given that the model's complexity increases. 
2. **Momentum**: to `0.9`, keeping the momentum consistent, which often benefits convergence during training. 
3. **Optimizer**: `SGD` is selected as it works well with standard learning rate schedules and provides stable training for deeper models.
4. **Scheduler**: I chose `StepLR`, which introduces a systematic way to reduce the learning rate during training, enhancing convergence for the deeper layers.

Finally, I set **Mu** to `0.01` to introduce some level of FedProx regularization without risking too much destabilization of the updates due to the limited capacity of the client.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client is performing poorly with a final test accuracy of 54.91%, indicating instability in training. Given that this client is in a low-resource environment, we should consider lowering the learning rate and batch size to improve stability.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 0
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 0] ---
  - Reasoning: The hyperparameters selected for the client and server are tailored to the moderate resource capacity of the client while addressing the specific requirements of a split federated learning setup.

**Client-Side Hyperparameters:**
1. **Learning Rate (0.001):** This value is a balanced starting point within the range of 0.0001 to 0.01, promoting stable convergence.
2. **Weight Decay (0.0001):** A low weight decay is suitable, keeping the model from overfitting while allowing sufficient learning capability.
3. **Momentum (0.9):** Strong momentum helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions and smoothens updates, leading to faster convergence.
4. **Optimizer (AdamW):** AdamW is preferred as it adapts the learning rates for different parameters, which can be beneficial for training deep models like ResNet18 on MNIST data.
5. **Scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR):** This scheduler is good for adjusting learning rates over time, helping to fine-tune the model as it converges.
6. **Local Epochs (1):** Given this is the first round, a single local epoch allows the client to start without significant overfitting risk.
7. **Batch Size (32):** This size strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and the ability to generalize well in a medium-resource setting.
8. **Dropout Rate (0.2):** A moderate dropout rate helps reduce overfitting, especially beneficial when training on lower-quality datasets like MNIST.

**Server-Side Hyperparameters:**
1. **Learning Rate (0.005):** A slightly higher learning rate for the server could be beneficial, given that it is managing a more complex model configuration with more layers.
2. **Momentum (0.9):** Retaining momentum at this level remains consistent with the client's strategy for smoother gradient descent.
3. **Optimizer (SGD):** The server runs a more complex model, and SGD can provide solid performance by benefiting from its straightforward nature and converging efficiently in large-scale problems.
4. **Scheduler (StepLR):** This scheduler allows for a clear and structured reduction in the learning rate, which suits the server's role with deeper layers needing precise tuning.

**Mu (0.01):** A small value for mu ensures that FedProx regularization plays a minor role, which is justified in the first round of training for this client, as there is no existing peer data to heavily influence this client’s model updates.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 4
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 4] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for Client 4, we should start with conservative hyperparameters that align with the peer's hyperparameters from the most relevant previous round (Client 0). The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a common starting point and aligns with Client 0, allowing for stable convergence. Weight decay is selected at 1e-05, moderately helping manage overfitting given the moderate capacity of the client. Momentum is set to 0.9, which is a standard value that provides a good balance between stability and speed in the optimization process. Optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen as it generally performs better on image datasets like MNIST due to its adaptive learning rate properties. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' was previously used and can help improve convergence, especially on a dataset like MNIST. Since the client has a medium resource capacity, a batch size of 32 is chosen, which is manageable and allows for sufficient gradient updates. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 is applied to still retain some regularizing effects without impacting training too much. On the server side, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 is preferred for the deeper layers to ensure effective learning, while still remaining within the same range as Client 0. The optimizer remains 'SGD' to manage the complexities of the deeper layers effectively, with a momentum of 0.9 to maintain speed in gradient descent. 'StepLR' serves here as a good choice of scheduler since it can handle deep learning models by modifying the learning rate in defined steps, thus giving the server model better learning stability. For the mu parameter, we set it at 0.01, which allows for a bit of regularization from the FedProx term while still giving importance to the local updates of the client.

  Client 4, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 93.98%, Test Acc 85.54%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 28
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 28] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 28 is the first round with a medium-resource client setup, hyperparameters need to balance performance and resource efficiency. Based on the previous clients' performances, we focus on a moderate learning rate and a manageable batch size to ensure smooth training. We choose a learning rate of 0.001, which works well based on Client 0 and Client 4's results. Weight decay is set at 1e-05 for regularization without over-penalizing, and momentum at 0.9, as it has proven effective in other cases. The optimizer is selected as 'AdamW', aligned with the trend in previous successful hyperparameters. The local epochs remain at 1, and the batch size is 32, suitable for medium resource constraints without overwhelming computational limits. The dropout rate is set to 0.2 to help with overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively without being overly restrictive. 

For the server hyperparameters, a learning rate of 0.005 will provide a good balance between stability and the speed of learning. The momentum is kept at 0.9, which is beneficial for convergence, while the SGD optimizer is chosen due to its reliable performance in deeper models, especially where complexity is concerned. A 'StepLR' scheduler is employed for a controlled decay of the learning rate, benefiting long-term training stability. Finally, the mu value is set to 0.01 to encourage regularization effects from FedProx without being overly restrictive on the learning.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 18
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 18] ---
  - Reasoning: For client 18, moderate resources suggest a balanced set of hyperparameters that leverage performance while avoiding potential overload. Given that this is the first round of training, it is wise to start cautiously but optimally. Based on prior clients' results, a learning rate of 0.001 has proven effective, particularly as Client 4 achieved 82.91% accuracy with similar learning rates. A weight decay of 1e-05 would help mitigate overfitting while remaining in the low range, validated by comparative outcomes where almost all clients utilize similar values. The momentum at 0.9 is standard across previous usages and aligns with many successful optimizers, reducing oscillation during training. The optimizer should remain as 'AdamW', preferred by various clients and known for its adaptive properties, enhancing learning. Using 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the learning rate scheduler may help manage learning rates dynamically as seen in other successful experiments. With local_epochs fixed at 1, we can ensure that the training process remains efficient, and a batch size of 32 fits well with moderate resource constraints, matching past successful configurations. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 can help prevent overfitting while being not too aggressive. On the server side, given the split in model layers, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 may be optimal, as indicated by previous successful configurations, allowing for a more aggressive and swift convergence. The server is complex enough to justify momentum also at 0.9, while maintaining SGD as the optimizer, as it suits traditional setups in federated learning. A 'StepLR' scheduler is useful here as it helps manage the quickly changing learning rate as model weights are updated. Lastly, I will set the mu parameter to 0.01, balancing between local regularization and collaborative learning.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 20] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high-resource capabilities of Client 20 and its first round of training, I've selected hyperparameters that leverage this capacity while ensuring stability and convergence. Starting with the 'learning_rate', a value of 0.005 provides a balanced approach—not too aggressive to risk divergence and not too timid to hinder learning. A 'weight_decay' of 1e-05 helps prevent overfitting, especially since there's no prior training history to leverage. The chosen 'momentum' of 0.9 facilitates faster convergence by dampening oscillations, and the 'optimizer' is set to 'AdamW' to adaptively adjust the learning rates. As this is only a single local epoch, the 'batch_size' of 64 allows for effective gradient estimates, and a 'dropout_rate' of 0.2 introduces some regularization while being robust with the model's architecture. I’ve selected 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler to allow for dynamic learning rate adjustments, which can be beneficial in the early stages. 

For the server, since it is handling a deeper network structure with potential complexity, I've opted for a 'learning_rate' of 0.003, which aims to stabilize learning considering it will operate on the model's final layers. The 'momentum' is retained at 0.9, the same as the client, to maintain momentum through the federated learning process. I chose 'SGD' as the optimizer for the server to provide controlled updates to the model, and 'StepLR' is selected as the scheduler to gradually reduce the learning rate over time, which can improve convergence for deeper models. Finally, I've set 'mu' to 0.01, providing moderate regularization, which is helpful in federated settings to balance client and server updates.

  Client 20, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 83.91%, Test Acc 36.03%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 8
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 8] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for Client 8 and they are in a high-resource cluster, we can afford to select more aggressive hyperparameters that favor faster learning and potentially higher accuracy. Considering that Client 20, which served as a peer reference, used an optimizer and parameters that yielded 49.83% accuracy, we’ll build upon that:

1. **Learning Rate:** Setting a higher learning rate of 0.005, slightly above Client 20's, which is aggressive enough to help this high-resource client take full advantage of their computational capabilities.
2. **Weight Decay:** Choosing 1e-05 to control overfitting, similar to Client 20, while not being overly restrictive given the model’s depth and dataset characteristics.
3. **Momentum:** We’ll set momentum at 0.9, a common choice that adds stability to training and has previously worked well.
4. **Optimizer:** Choosing 'AdamW' allows for better handling of sparse gradients, crucial for a model like ResNet18, which tends to have various learning dynamics across layers.
5. **Scheduler:** 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected for better convergence, given its ability to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training.
6. **Local Epochs:** As the options only allow `1`, we will stick with this, as multiple epochs are not on the table for this client.
7. **Batch Size:** A batch size of 64 is appropriate for high-resource clients, allowing for efficient gradient estimation without overwhelming memory.
8. **Dropout Rate:** We set this at 0.2 to help prevent overfitting without losing too much capacity since learning is critical in the initial phases.

For server-side parameters, considering that the server is handling the final layer, a slightly different approach is warranted:
1. **Learning Rate:** Lowered to 0.003 to stabilize the deeper model and accommodate its complexity.
2. **Momentum:** Retaining the value of 0.9 as it has been effective previously.
3. **Optimizer:** Opting for 'SGD' here as it generally performs better on larger batches and structured layers typically found in deep models.
4. **Scheduler:** 'StepLR' is selected to reduce the learning rate at regular intervals, allowing for fine-tuning of weights as training progresses.

Lastly, for `mu`, setting it at a value of 0.01 balances the regularization impact from FedProx, allowing some flexibility while still aiding convergence in a federated environment.

  Client 8, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 86.25%, Test Acc 64.80%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 7
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 7] ---
  - Reasoning: Considering the client ID is 7 and falls under a high-resource cluster, we can optimize the hyperparameters for performance. Starting with the learning rate, given that Client 20 and Client 8 both utilized a learning rate of 0.005 with limited success, we can increase it slightly to 0.006 to emphasize exploration of better learning. The weight decay can be set low (e.g., 5e-05) to avoid overly penalizing the weights early in training, as significant regularization might reduce model expressiveness in the first round. Momentum is kept at 0.9 to stabilize updates due to the potential skew of infinities in gradient steps. 'AdamW' optimizer is chosen for its adaptive learning rate capability which is advantageous for handling varying patterns in data like that present in MNIST images. A batch size of 64 is an appropriate choice for high-resource clients, as it balances memory usage and training stability. The dropout rate is set to 0.2 to introduce regularization without significantly impacting learning. The local epochs will be fixed at 1 as it's the only option available. For the server, we follow the previous usage trend with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum at 0.9, and choose 'SGD' optimizer for its consistent performance on deep architectures. Additionally, 'StepLR' is adopted for learning rate scheduling on the server side to allow a controlled decay over steps. The mu parameter is set to 0.01, allowing for effective regularization while still enabling the model to learn meaningful patterns.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 2
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 2] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high-resource capacity of Client 2, a larger batch size of 64 enhances efficiency without overwhelming the system. The learning rate is set to 0.006, slightly higher than peers to encourage faster convergence. For weight decay, I've chosen 5e-05 as it balances regularization while maintaining learning dynamics. The momentum of 0.9 promotes consistent updates in gradient descent. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as it's proven effective for complex models like ResNet. A 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is selected for its capacity to adjust the learning rate dynamically across epochs. A dropout rate of 0.2 is kept to mitigate overfitting. Given that this is the first round for the client, I keep 'local_epochs' at 1. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.003 is chosen to balance updates from the client, with 'SGD' providing stability for gradient updates. The momentum is set at 0.9 for consistency. I opted for a 'StepLR' scheduler, as it will likely adapt well to the remaining layers of the model. Finally, for mu, set to 0.01, allows for a bit of FedProx regularization to encourage the model to stay close to the global model while still being flexible.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 27
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 27] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 27 is a high-resource client and this is their first round, we want to leverage their capabilities while also considering the peer performance insights. Clients 20, 8, and 2 achieved moderate accuracies with lower learning rates, while Client 7, which incorporated a slightly higher learning rate of 0.006 and a weight decay of 5e-05, achieved a significantly better accuracy at 68.98%. Therefore, we will set the learning rate slightly higher at 0.006. A weight decay of 5e-05 is also chosen based on the successful peers, optimizing regularization without overfitting. We will maintain the AdamW optimizer, as it has been consistently used by successful peers, with a CosineAnnealingLR scheduler to effectively handle the learning rate during the local training. Given the batch size options, we can optimize for larger batches due to high resource availability, thus setting it at 64. We will also use a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting. The local epochs remain at 1 as this is a norm for first rounds and we've seen that other clients have succeeded with this setting.

On the server side, a learning rate of 0.003 is chosen to align with the lower complexity model beyond the split point, and given that this value appears favorable from the results shared. We will continue using SGD as it was employed by successful peers, with a StepLR scheduler suitable for updating the learning rate. This configuration allows for effective convergence while considering the complexity and nature of the model split. A mu value of 0.01 is selected to moderately regulate the contribution of the Federated regularization that adjusts the learning on the server, based on previous peer selections.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 3
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 3] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource nature of Client 3, the selected hyperparameters prioritize stability and efficiency while still aiming to improve performance. The learning rate is set at 0.0005, which is towards the upper limit of the range and is slightly reduced compared to the previous epoch's 0.001 to accommodate the client's limitations. A small weight decay of 1e-06 is chosen to prevent overfitting without imposing excessive regularization. The momentum is set at 0.9 for effective gradient descent; this is relatively standard and promotes faster convergence. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as this is well-suited for smooth loss landscapes, and using it can help in stabilizing learning in low-resource scenarios. The scheduler is set to 'None' to avoid complications given the client's capacity issues, retaining a straightforward approach. The local_epochs is set to 1 since increasing this could lead to additional computational burden. A batch size of 16 is the smallest option, which is necessary to fit into the low-resource context. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.1 is reasonable to help with regularization while being mindful of the limited computational capacity.

On the server side, the learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a moderate value to help fine-tune the more complex part of the model without overshooting. A momentum of 0.9 is kept consistent to facilitate convergence of the server's deeper model. The optimizer is chosen as 'SGD' since it often benefits from uniform updates across trained layers. The scheduler is set to 'StepLR', which introduces a controlled decay in the learning rate, helping to stabilize training as it converges. Finally, the mu parameter is set to 0.01, which applies a light regularization through FedProx to encourage consistency in the federated learning process without overly penalizing the client's autonomy.

  Client 3, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 97.05%, Test Acc 65.85%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 9
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 9] ---
  - Reasoning: Considering the context of Client 9 as a low-resource client with its first round of training, it is essential to choose hyperparameters that facilitate stable learning. The learning rate is chosen to be relatively low at 0.0005 to mitigate instability during training, in line with Client 3's configuration which also resulted in a reasonable accuracy. A weight decay of 1e-06 is selected to help prevent overfitting while still being conservative, given the client's resource restrictions. The momentum is set at 0.9, which is commonly used and should work well with both AdamW and SGD optimizers. The optimizer 'AdamW' is selected due to its adaptive nature, which benefits low-resource clients by adjusting the learning rate for various parameters. The local epochs are confined to 1, as this is the only option available for the client. A batch size of 16 is chosen, the smallest recommended size, to reduce memory usage and ensure stability during updates. The dropout rate is kept low at 0.1 to support learning without excessively restricting model capacity in this initial round.

For the server side, given that the server has to handle the remaining three layers, it should have a slightly higher learning rate set to 0.001 to allow for deeper updates, complementing the complexity of the model. The momentum is also set at 0.9, similar to the client. The SGD optimizer is utilized for server-side training due to its robustness and effectiveness in deep networks. The scheduler is set to 'StepLR' to allow for gradual decay of the learning rate, promoting long-term training stability. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 is chosen for the FedProx regularization, balancing the local update and central knowledge, as seen in the peer's experience.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 17
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 17] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource constraints of Client 17, I am recommending specific hyperparameters that will help improve model training stability and accuracy while adhering to the search space constraints. The peer histories indicate that lower learning rates have benefited Clients 3 and 9, suggesting Client 17 should similarly use a lower learning rate for stable training. Additionally, I will retain the batch size at 16, as it has worked in the past and fits the client's low-resource status. The optimizer remains AdamW for its effective handling of non-stationary objectives in low-resource settings. The weight decay will be set at 1e-06 as it was effective in the peer experiments while still encouraging some regularization without being excessive. A dropout rate of 0.1 is kept, as it strikes a balance between preventing overfitting and maintaining model capacity. Local epochs remain at 1 due to the client capacity constraints. For the server hyperparameters, a higher learning rate than that of the client will help in faster convergence during training due to its role in processing the deeper layers of the model. For the server optimizer, using SGD is appropriate, as it is traditional for deeper networks. The server momentum is set to 0.9 and the scheduler is kept as StepLR for learning rate adjustments that can help improve convergence over time. The value of mu is set to 0.01, consistent with previous tests showing stability under FedProx regularization.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 24
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 24] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 24 belongs to a low-resource capacity cluster, adjustments are necessary to ensure stable training. Previous clients with a test accuracy below 90% utilized lower learning rates, primarily in the 0.0005 range, which indicates that a gradual decrease in the learning rate can stabilize training for weak clients. Reducing the batch size to 16 would further accommodate the low-resource environment while maintaining efficiency. The learning rate is set to 0.0005, noting that Client 9, which used this learning rate, achieved relatively high accuracy. The `weight_decay` value is minimized to 1e-06 to lessen the regularization penalty, allowing the model to learn better. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen due to its ability to handle sparse gradients effectively, beneficial in low-resource scenarios. The `scheduler` is set to 'None' to exclude additional complexities that learning rate scheduling could introduce in low resource scenarios. The dropout rate is maintained at a minimal level (0.1) to prevent overfitting without being too aggressive, allowing effective feature learning while remaining conservative due to the low resources. The `local_epochs` will remain at 1 as it didn’t change from the prior successful executions.

For the server, given it runs a deeper segment of the network, a higher learning rate (0.005) is selected, which works effectively with SGD as seen during the peer analysis. The selection of SGD provides a strong foundation when training deeper layers as it can provide more stability. The server will have a momentum of 0.9 to ensure fast convergence, as seen in successful training outputs and learning progress. The scheduler is set to 'StepLR' which allows for a structured decay of the learning rate, addressing the deeper complexities in server-side training that could lead to better convergence rates. Finally, the `mu` value is kept at the default of 0.01 as it has previously yielded reasonable regularization without excessively penalizing the local clients, which is important in a federated setting.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client's test accuracy is relatively low at 84.13%, indicating potential instability in training. Given the low-resource capacity of this client, I will reduce the learning rate to allow for more stable gradient updates, and I will decrease the batch size to accommodate limited resource availability. Additionally, I will consider alternative optimizers to potentially improve convergence.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 28
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 28] ---
  - Reasoning: In optimizing the hyperparameters for Client ID 28 in a Split Federated Learning context using the ResNet18 model on MNIST, I considered the medium resource capacity and the specifics of the previous performance. The client achieved a test accuracy of 53.80% in the first epoch, indicating room for improvement. For the client hyperparameters, I have slightly increased the learning rate to 0.002, which is within the recommended range for better convergence without risking divergence, especially given the previous epoch's performance. The weight decay was adjusted to 1e-04, which provides regularization while still allowing for exploration of the parameter space. The batch size is set to 32, as it balances optimized training time and resource constraints. I retained the AdamW optimizer, as it can provide better convergence rates on deeper networks and is well-suited for residual networks. The dropout rate is maintained at 0.25, promoting regularization while allowing for sufficient learning. Local epochs remain at 1 considering the limited operational capacity.

On the server side, I propose keeping the learning rate at 0.005 to maintain a stable update cycle in relation to the client's updates. The optimizer choice of SGD is suitable for the server given its more robust convergence with the heavier layers as it allows deeper gradient updates. The scheduler is set as StepLR to adapt the learning rate over time and accommodate gradual learning curve improvements. As for mu, I have kept it as 0.01 because it effectively balances the local and global objectives of weight updates, particularly with FedProx regularization.

  Client 28, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 99.17%, Test Acc 75.05%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 16
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 16] ---
  - Reasoning: The client's local training settings need to balance the moderate resources and the learning experience from peer client 28, which achieved a 77.81% accuracy. Given this first round for client 16, I recommend starting with the following settings:
- **Learning Rate:** Set to 0.001, which is a middle ground in the provided range and commonly effective for gradual learning without being too aggressive.
- **Weight Decay:** Used a moderate value of `5e-05` to prevent overfitting, considering the dropout rate can also help with regularization.
- **Momentum:** Set at `0.9`, based on its common effectiveness in SGD for faster convergence and as seen in peer client configurations.
- **Optimizer:** Choose `SGD`, as it aligns well with the proposed settings of peer client 28 and is preferable for training deeper models like ResNet.
- **Scheduler:** Use `CosineAnnealingLR`, which can adjust the learning rate dynamically during training, theoretically improving accuracy, especially in early rounds of federated learning.
- **Local Epochs:** Limited to `1`, given this is the first round, data accumulation across clients is likely critical at this point.
- **Batch Size:** Set to `32` to provide a reasonable trade-off between learning stability and resource usage while completing the local training within client capacity. 
- **Dropout Rate:** Set to `0.25`, providing sufficient regularization without overly limiting the model capacity, based on the available range.

On the server side, since it handles the later layers of the model and likely has varying complexity, the following settings are optimal:
- **Learning Rate:** A slightly higher rate of `0.005`, allowing for efficient training as the server processes information from multiple clients.
- **Momentum:** Maintained at `0.9` for alignment with the client’s momentum, supporting continuity in optimization strategies.
- **Optimizer:** Stick with `SGD` to maintain consistency across both client and server unless evidence suggests a different optimizer would yield better results during training.
- **Scheduler:** Use `StepLR` for a simpler rate decay strategy that can stabilize training as updates from clients are integrated.

Finally, I recommend setting `mu` to `0.01`, maintaining a regularization aimed at balancing local client learning while stabilizing the global model across the federated network.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 19
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 19] ---
  - Reasoning: Given Client 19 is a medium-resource client and based on the performance of peer clients, we aim for stable and effective HPs. We notice Client 16 achieved a better accuracy (82.55%) with a slightly higher learning rate (0.001) and lower weight decay than Client 28. To balance model training and avoid overfitting, I selected a weight decay of 5e-05. For optimization, SGD with momentum 0.9 is consistent with peer clients and typically performs well on image datasets like MNIST. Given this is the first round for Client 19, I recommend a standard batch size of 32 for moderate resource usage. A single local epoch is suggested to avoid excessive computation given the client's capacity. Dropout rate is set at 0.25 based on peer usage to improve generalization without over-complicating the model. On the server side, considering the deeper model configuration and need for adaptive learning due to FedProx regularization, I opted for a learning rate of 0.005, momentum of 0.9, SGD optimizer, and a StepLR scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training efficiently. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is chosen, as it is consistently applied in both peer client cases, ensuring stabilization with FedProx regularization.

  Client 19, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 98.62%, Test Acc 93.55%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 6
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 6] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for Client 6 and considering the data on peers with previous results, this client should adopt a conservative approach to hyperparameter selection. The learning rate should be set to 0.001, as it has worked well in the past for peers like Client 16 and Client 19, balancing training speed and stability. A weight decay of 5e-05 is chosen to help regularize the model without being too constraining. The momentum of 0.9 is selected for better convergence during training based on successful peer usage. Using SGD as the optimizer aligns with peer configurations and has shown effectiveness. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is recommended as it has been beneficial for peers, allowing dynamic adaptation of the learning rate. Given the client's medium resource capabilities and based on peer average batches, a batch size of 32 is selected for effective gradient updates. Since the client is new in this round, `local_epochs` will remain at 1. A dropout rate of 0.25 is chosen to help prevent overfitting. For the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 and momentum of 0.9 align with successful configurations while using SGD for consistency. The scheduler 'StepLR' will facilitate stepwise adjustments in learning, matching the complexity of deeper server models. Finally, 'mu' is set to 0.01 as previously shown to assist in the balance of local and global model accuracy while addressing the variances in federated learning.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 4] ---
  - Reasoning: The selection of hyperparameters considers both the client's past performance and the peer clients' performance. The client has previously achieved a relatively high accuracy of 82.91% with HPs that include a learning rate of 0.001, weight decay of 1e-05, and a batch size of 32. Considering the context indicates a medium-resource client capacity, it's prudent to keep local training demanding but manageable. The learning rate should be kept the same to see consistent results, while a slightly higher weight decay of 5e-05 may offer increased regularization, as the peers that had a similar high weight decay performed well. The batch size will remain at 32, maintaining efficiency in computation while allowing sufficient gradient estimation. The use of AdamW is consistent with prior usage, supporting good convergence characteristics without unnecessary complexity. As for the server settings, a learning rate of 0.005 is retained for comparable results in split learning environments and aligns with previously successful peers. The SGD optimizer is preferred here for its stability in convergence at the server level, while still aligning with peer practices. The mu value is kept constant at 0.01, as changes in the regularization balance have previously resulted in better performance for the client. Overall, the adjustments made are minimal, as they fine-tune high-performing parameters rather than overhaul them completely.

  - Reasoning: Based on the performance of similar clients and the refinement analysis, we need to adjust the hyperparameters for improved accuracy. For the client side, a learning rate of 0.001 balances exploration and convergence, while a weight decay of 0.0001 helps prevent overfitting, taking cues from successful peers. The momentum remains at 0.9 which aligns with the majority of successful configurations. Switching the optimizer to 'SGD' could align with higher performing peers, and using 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the scheduler allows adaptive learning rate which is beneficial for training stability. The local epochs are kept at 1 due to capacity constraints, and the batch size is set to 32 to ensure efficient gradient updates while avoiding resource overload. The dropout rate is maintained at 0.25 to introduce regularization without hampering learning. For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is suitable for more complex layers of the network, and 'SGD' is chosen to match the client optimizer, leveraging consistency in updates. The momentum is optimized similarly at 0.9, ensuring smooth convergence. The mu is set at 0.01 to maintain FedProx regularization.

  - Reasoning: Given that this client has a high-resource capacity, I opted for an increased learning rate of 0.007. This value was chosen as it is higher than the previous learning rate (0.006) while still remaining within the acceptable range without being aggressive enough to cause instability. For the weight decay, I kept the value at 5e-05 to help regularize the model without dampening the learning. The momentum is recommended to be kept at 0.9 as it has been shown to work well with ResNet architectures and is the same value previously used. The optimizer 'AdamW' is selected due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rates and prevent overfitting through weight decay. I opted for 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the learning rate scheduler since it has shown good results with similar training scenarios. As the client can handle larger batch sizes, I increased the batch size to 128, which fall into its high-resource category. The dropout rate of 0.2 is retained to help prevent overfitting without losing too much model capacity. The local epochs remain the same since we know an epoch count of 1 has been effective in previous tasks. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.004 is an optimal choice for the deeper model architecture. The 'SGD' optimizer is preferable for server-side tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness, along with a momentum value of 0.9. I recommend 'StepLR' for scheduling to manage learning over rounds more effectively with decreased learning rates as the rounds progress. The mu value of 0.01 is kept constant for FedProx regularization based on previous recommendations. Overall, these hyperparameters should foster improved collaborative learning while optimizing resources.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 20
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 20] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high-resource capability of the client, we can increase the learning rate and batch size while maintaining an optimal balance for convergence and generalization. The client achieved 49.83% test accuracy in the previous round with a learning rate of 0.005, indicating that a moderate increase may lead to better performance. The peer's usage of a learning rate of 0.007 showing a significant accuracy improvement suggests we should push closer to that value. Therefore, I propose a learning rate of 0.007, which is a progressive step. The weight decay is adjusted to 3e-05, providing a good regularization against overfitting, while aligning more closely to peers. We'll retain the AdamW optimizer for its effectiveness in adaptive learning environments. The CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is maintained as it helps in achieving better convergence at lower learning rates, and the dropout rate remains steady at 0.2 to avoid overfitting. The batch size is increased to 64 for faster gradient computation. Lastly, local_epochs stay fixed at 1. For the server, which runs a more complex final layer, a slightly lower learning rate of 0.004 ensures stability in training while still allowing for potential improvements. The SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 is retained as it was previously effective, and the StepLR scheduler is selected to dynamically adjust the learning rate as training progresses. The mu parameter remains at 0.01, providing a consistent level of FedProx regularization from the previous training cycle.

  - LLM Reasoning: The test accuracy is quite low, indicating potential issues with learning rates, batch sizes, and possibly overfitting due to the complexity of the ResNet18 model on the MNIST dataset. The learning rate for the client may be too high, and there is room to explore larger batch sizes given the high-resource capacity. Additionally, I will consider increasing the dropout rate to mitigate overfitting.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 11
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 11] ---
  - Reasoning: For the client-side hyperparameters, I suggest using a learning rate of 0.007. This value aligns closely with what Client 27 and Client 20 used, contributing to a balance between stability and convergence speed, especially since this is the client's first round and they have high computational resources. The weight decay is set to 4e-05, which is a slightly conservative value within the allowed range that will help avoid overfitting, while still being competitive. The momentum is set at 0.9 to ensure stable updates. I chose the 'AdamW' optimizer for its effective handling of sparse gradients, which can be beneficial when training with Dropout. The learning scheduler will be 'CosineAnnealingLR' to provide a good adaptation of the learning rate over iterations, which will help in convergence. For local_epochs, I suggest using 1, given the constraints in the task. A higher batch size of 64 takes advantage of the client's high resource capability, improving the gradient estimate with more data processed at once. The dropout rate is kept low at 0.1 to maintain model complexity while reducing the risk of overfitting since the first round of training can be tricky for convergence.

For the server-side hyperparameters, I opted for a learning rate of 0.004, which is slightly lower than the client's learning rate, allowing the server to make more cautious updates in learning the parameters from the last layer of the model. I used SGD as the optimizer due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling the models with a lower number of parameters post the split. The momentum is also kept at 0.9 to maintain consistency with the client's settings. I suggest using 'StepLR' as the scheduler, to adjust the learning rate at specified intervals, helping maintain the learning objectives through the training course. Finally, I have set mu to 0.01, which is a moderate value balancing between local training and global aggregation, as per the prior clients' performance metrics.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 5
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 5] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 5 operates in a high-resource environment, it's beneficial to maximize the training effectiveness by choosing aggressive hyperparameters. For the learning rate, setting it to 0.007 is aligned with successful configurations from Clients 27, 20, and 11 without being too aggressive as seen previously. Weight decay is kept small at 5e-05, providing a subtle regularization effect based on previous successes. Momentum is maintained at 0.9, which is consistent with previous client configurations, facilitating effective gradient updates. The optimizer 'AdamW' was commonly effective across peer configurations, providing adaptive learning rates which are particularly useful in varied data settings. The scheduler chosen is 'CosineAnnealingLR' to efficiently manage learning rate decay while avoiding the pitfalls of constant learning rates in converging towards minima. Given the model type (ResNet18), a batch size of 64 leverages the cluster's high resources without being overly burdensome, and this value was similar to configurations that yielded good accuracy. A dropout rate of 0.1 is established to aid in regularization and fitting without underfitting the data, based on prior trials. As this is the client’s first round, a conservative approach with some exploration of hyperparameter space is beneficial. For the server, a more complex model structure warrants a learning rate of 0.004 aligned with Client learning rates but slightly lower for stability. The same momentum of 0.9 is beneficial for synchronizing updates efficiently. 'SGD' as the optimizer suits a more straightforward learning dynamic resulting from fewer updated parameters. The 'StepLR' scheduler is chosen to provide a more traditional decaying schedule conducive to stabilizing the learning process later in training. Lastly, the FedProx regularization parameter mu is set to 0.01, which balances the Client's local objectives with the Server's global goal effectively, providing a good balance between personalization and generalization.

  Client 5, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 55.03%, Test Acc 40.61%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 10
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 10] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 10 is a high-resource client with the capability to handle larger batch sizes and aggressive learning rates, I've opted for the highest available batch size of 64 to facilitate better gradient estimation. The learning rate is set to 0.007, matching the successful HPs of peers while remaining under the threshold of too aggressive settings observed in previous clients. The choice of AdamW as the optimizer aligns with the observed trends in prior client results, suggesting its effectiveness. A scheduler of CosineAnnealingLR is selected for its ability to improve convergence while allowing the learning rate to adapt over epochs. For weight decay, I chose a value of 5e-05, slightly more than the previous peer average, to mitigate overfitting, especially given this is the client's first training round. Momentum remains consistent at 0.9 to maintain stability in the learning process, and I kept local_epochs at 1 as advised by previous peer experiences and based on the selected training configuration. The dropout rate is set at 0.1 to add regularization without too much loss of information.

On the server side, the learning rate is set to 0.004 to maintain stability, following the previous peers' average to ensure fine-tuning. Using SGD aligns well with the server’s functionality of processing the fewer remaining layers, allowing precise updates. The momentum is again set at 0.9 while opting for StepLR as the scheduler to adjust the learning rate effectively after a set number of epochs. 

For the mu value, a moderate selection of 0.01 is made, balancing the influence of the local client updates and the global model updates.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 3
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 3] ---
  - Reasoning: For the client, as a low-resource client (Cluster 0), we must prioritize stability in training. The model has previously trained with a learning rate of 0.0005 which improved the test accuracy from 55.87% to 63.74%. In this context, I suggest maintaining a learning rate of 0.0005 to ensure consistency while still being aggressive enough to improve further. Additionally, I will opt for 'AdamW' as the optimizer given its effectiveness with lower resource clients, ensuring adaptive learning. Weight decay is adjusted slightly lower to 5e-07 to prevent overfitting as the model complexity increases. The momentum will stay at 0.9 since this hyperparameter has been stable across clients, and the batch size remains at 16 to accommodate the client's low resource capacity. Dropout is kept at 0.1 to manage overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively.

For the server, it is crucial to handle the remaining 3 layers with an appropriate learning rate. I suggest a learning rate of 0.001 since the server should have a higher capacity to learn compared to the client, and this rate is a common balance for fine-tuning deeper models like ResNet18. I will keep the optimizer as 'SGD', which is traditional for many neural networks, and maintain a momentum of 0.9 to stabilize convergence. I recommend using a 'StepLR' scheduler to adjust the learning rate over time, which is beneficial for deeper networks.

The value of mu will remain at 0.01, as it helps balance the local loss and the global model convergence effectively without making the federated learning unstable.

For the client, reducing the learning rate further and potentially decreasing the batch size may allow for more stable training given its low-resource nature. Additionally, considering the use of a learning rate scheduler could help in adapting the learning rate throughout training, improving convergence.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 1
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 1] ---
  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters are driven by the need to balance training stability and convergence performance given the low-resource nature of the client. For the client, a lower `learning_rate` of 0.0001 is chosen to ensure more stable updates during training, as higher rates could lead to instability for a low-capacity client. The `weight_decay` is set to a minimal value of 1e-06 to avoid overfitting given the limited computational power. A `momentum` of 0.9 is maintained from the historical values to support faster convergence. 'AdamW' is preferred as it generally works well for smaller datasets like MNIST. The `scheduler` is set to 'None' to avoid overhead, given the single local epoch and resource constraints. The `local_epochs` are fixed at 1 to limit resource usage. The `batch_size` remains at 16, which is manageable for a low-resource client, while the `dropout_rate` is increased to 0.2 to help regularize the model and combat overfitting. 

For the server, a `learning_rate` of 0.001 is chosen as it is at the lower end of the server's range, balancing precision and stability. The `momentum` remains at 0.9 to align with the client's choice, facilitating smoother optimization. Given the server's capacity, 'SGD' is chosen for its effectiveness in minimizing loss in gradient descent scenarios. The `scheduler` is set to 'StepLR' for scheduled learning rate decay, which helps in controlling overfitting by adjusting the learning rate during training. 

Lastly, `mu` is chosen as 0.01, consistent with the previous rounds. This value allows adequate regularization while still enabling the model to learn effectively from the local data.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 24
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 24] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that the Client ID 24 belongs to a low-resource cluster, careful attention has been paid to optimizing the hyperparameters for stable training. In the previous epoch, Client 24's performance was notably enhanced by reducing the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005 and decreasing the batch size to 16, resulting in a test accuracy of 84.13%. This indicates a trend towards better performance with smaller learning rates. Therefore, a further reduction to 0.0001 is advised to stabilize training while allowing for convergence. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW' due to its adaptive nature, which is beneficial in low-resource settings for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The weight decay can be slightly increased within the available range to 1e-05 to help with generalization. The batch size is kept at 16 to ensure that the client does not overburden its limited resources. For `local_epochs`, we stick to 1 to avoid excessive computation, and the dropout rate is adjusted to 0.2, which is a balanced choice to prevent overfitting while maintaining learning capacity. On the server side, since the model complexity increases with more layers, the learning rate is slightly higher at 0.001 to expedite training over several layers, with 'SGD' chosen as an effective optimizer, leveraging momenta appropriate for learning deep representations. Additionally, a `StepLR` scheduler is selected for controlled learning rate decay over epochs, fostering better convergence. The FedProx regularization parameter `mu` remains at 0.01, aligning with peer experiences and avoiding a drastic change which might destabilize the training.

  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource nature of Client 25 and the need to ensure stable training, the hyperparameters have been chosen accordingly. A learning rate of 0.0001 is selected, aligned with the previous successful clients, as it helps avoid instability in training for weak clients. A smaller batch size of 16 is utilized to accommodate the limited computational capacity. The weight decay is set to 1e-06, which provides regularization without being too aggressive. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 to encourage faster convergence while using the AdamW optimizer, which has previously shown good performance in similar contexts. The local epochs are kept at 1 since that's the only available option, ensuring quick iterations and adaptations. A dropout rate of 0.1 strikes a balance between regularization and information retention during training, aligning with others in the peer history who achieved strong results. For the server, an SGD optimizer is chosen because it is more effective with deeper architectures, and a learning rate of 0.001 is consistent with practices suggested in the literature for stable training. I recommend using StepLR for the scheduler, as it helps to decrease the learning rate progressively, which is beneficial for deep model training. Finally, a mu of 0.01 is employed, as this value aligns well with the values used by successful peers, effectively applying the FedProx regularization without making it overly restrictive.

  - Reasoning: Considering the low-resource capacity of Client 22, the hyperparameters have been set to favor stability and learning without overwhelming the client. The learning rate is kept low at 0.0001, as observed in the previous implementations, to ensure gradual learning. For weight decay, a value of 1e-06 is selected to help regularization without being too aggressive. Momentum is set to 0.9, as it has shown effective performance in similar scenarios. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW' due to its adaptive learning capabilities, which can help the client learn better even with fewer resources. A local epoch of 1 is used, as more epochs might complicate the training for a low-resource client. The batch size is kept at 16 to prevent memory overload while still allowing effective learning. A dropout rate of 0.1 is set, balancing between regularization and model capacity. On the server side, the learning rate is set slightly higher at 0.001 to accommodate the more complex model it will handle, which allows for more aggressive convergence. The momentum is also set to 0.9, consistent with the client's choice. The optimizer chosen is 'SGD', a common choice for server-side training tasks, which works well with the specified scheduler 'StepLR', enhancing training stability and performance. For the mu parameter, a value of 0.01 is used, as it aligns with similar clients in their successful runs and encourages regularization in the federated learning framework.

  - Reasoning: In determining the optimal hyperparameters for the client and server in this Split Federated Learning setup with ResNet18 on MNIST, we consider both the client's moderate resource capabilities and the server's complexity. The client has shown significant improvement in accuracy, especially with a learning rate increase alongside an adjusted `batch_size` and `dropout_rate`. For the client, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected as it is the upper limit in the range and should facilitate faster convergence while still being manageable for the client's capacity. A `weight_decay` of 1e-05 strikes a balance between standardization and retaining useful features. `Momentum` remains at 0.9, consistent with high performance in previous epochs. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW' which complements changing learning rates effectively, and the scheduler stays with 'CosineAnnealingLR' for smooth adjustments over epochs. The `local_epochs` is kept at 1 due to limited resources. We choose a `batch_size` of 32 to balance the tradeoff between training speed and model convergence, and the `dropout_rate` remains at 0.2 to prevent overfitting. On the server side, the choice of a learning rate of 0.002 aligns with complex layer training where a slightly higher rate may foster better convergence. The `momentum` remains 0.9, and the optimizer is consistent with SGD due to its effectiveness in large models. A `scheduler` of 'StepLR' is chosen since it can provide incrementally better learning rate adjustments over several epochs. The value of `mu` is maintained at 0.01 for consistent FedProx regularization, helping to balance local training with global model coherence.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 18
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 18] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the client's context and past performance, adjustments were made to optimize the hyperparameters. The client's previous learning rate of 0.001 was retained as it aligns with the search space and offered decent performance without being too aggressive. The weight decay was slightly increased to 1e-05 to improve regularization without overcomplicating the model for moderate resources. The momentum remains at 0.9, which is standard across various optimizers, and can effectively help accelerate the optimization. The optimizer was suggested to remain as 'AdamW' because it often performs better in optimizing sparse data, which is essential for MNIST. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' may help in adjusting the learning rate dynamically as it progresses through iterations. The local epochs remain at 1 due to moderate computing resources, along with a batch size of 32, which has provided a balance between learning stability and memory constraints. The dropout rate is set at 0.2 because it prevents overfitting while maintaining enough capacity to learn from the dataset.

For the server side, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected for fine-tuning the deeper layers, aligning with the complexity of its model architecture. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 to ensure stability in convergence. The SGD optimizer is chosen as it's generally effective for larger models, and the scheduler 'StepLR' is implemented to reduce the learning rate at scheduled intervals, which is crucial for deeper networks. Finally, mu is retained at 0.01, balancing between individual client optimization and global convergence.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 13] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the context of Client 13, who has moderate capacity and has seen improvement in accuracy with recent peer experiments, we will refine the hyperparameters to ensure a better training performance. The client's last test accuracy of 51.67% suggests there's room for improvement. Notably, Client 18 achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94.91% with a lower learning rate (0.0005), which indicates that adjustments in the learning rate might help. The optimizer remains optimized towards AdamW for its adaptive properties. The weight decay will be slightly adjusted to counteract overfitting, given the dropout rates observed in peers. Batch size will be increased to 64, which should suit the medium-resource capacity while optimizing throughput. For the server, maintaining momentum at 0.9 with the optimizer set to AdamW aligns with best practices for complex models. A learning rate of 0.005 is chosen for a robust optimization trajectory, and CosineAnnealingLR as a scheduler helps manage the learning rate dynamically as training proceeds. The mu parameter will remain at 0.01 to ensure FedProx regularization is effective.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 16
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 16] ---
  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters aim to improve the client model's performance based on previous results while considering the client’s resource constraints. For the client, I opted for a learning rate of 0.0005, which is on the higher side of the available range and has shown some positive results in peer histories, particularly with Client 18 achieving a high accuracy with this rate. I kept the weight decay at a moderate 1e-05 to prevent overfitting while avoiding excessive regularization. The momentum value remains unchanged at 0.9 as it has been consistent across several peers achieving reasonable accuracy. The optimizer choice switched from SGD to AdamW, as it has been more effective for other clients, showing a performance uptick in iteratively more complex training scenarios. The scheduler is chosen as 'CosineAnnealingLR' because it can adaptively adjust the learning rate, which could further benefit the accuracy. Given the client’s moderate resources, I’m retaining `local_epochs` at 1, but adjusted `batch_size` to 64 to help improve learning as larger batches can stabilize training noise. I slightly reduced the dropout rate to 0.2 to allow more learning capacity in view of the adjusted parameters.

For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen since it falls within the mid-range and will allow for moderate adjustments, maintaining performance without overshooting optimization. The momentum for the server is also kept consistent at 0.9 for stability in weight updates. SGD was chosen as the server optimizer, following its general efficacy across previous server implementations and trials in similar federated learning setups. The scheduler for the server is selected to be 'StepLR' to allow a clear, delineated approach to learning adjustment over fixed intervals, which can be beneficial for fine-tuning the model further. Lastly, the `mu` value is retained at 0.01, continuing to balance the FedProx regularization without being overly restrictive. Overall, these adjustments are based on performance metrics, peer results, and optimization strategies that have worked well in past iterations.

  - Reasoning: Considering the client's high-resource capacity, a larger batch size of 64 is optimal for stable gradient updates, while a relatively high learning rate of 0.005 allows for fast convergence without overshooting. A weight decay of 5e-05 helps prevent overfitting, and maintaining a momentum of 0.9 will aid in smooth convergence. The chosen optimizer is AdamW for efficient training with adaptive learning rates, and 'CosineAnnealingLR' is preferred for achieving a good learning rate schedule. Given that the client can use maximum local epochs of 1, this setting aligns well. The dropout rate of 0.2 strikes a balance between regularization and model capacity. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.003 with SGD optimizer is feasible given the server's complex task, while a momentum of 0.9 maintains stability in updates. The scheduler 'StepLR' is suited for managing the learning rate progressively. The mu value is set at 0.01 for FedProx regularization to ensure some level of stability without overly constraining the local updates.

  - Reasoning: Considering the context provided, we want to enhance the client's performance based on previous training results while optimizing the server's performance. The client's last epoch results (~72.28% accuracy) suggest that the target learning rate is near the values used in the previous epochs. I will keep the weight decay low to avoid over-regularization since the client can afford more flexibility with a high-resource capacity. Similarly, the optimizer choice will remain 'AdamW' due to its historical performance for the client, combined with a moderate batch size for efficiency. The client's batch size will be increased to 64, as the previous epoch with that size had a better result. The dropout rate remains consistent to prevent overfitting while providing robustness. The local epochs will stay at 1, given the client's capabilities. For the server's parameters, the learning rate will be set to a slightly higher value than in previous rounds, as depth increases complexity. 'SGD', paired with a 'StepLR' scheduler, suits the server's task well, as the server runs a more complex model requiring steady learning rate adjustments. Finally, setting 'mu' to 0.01 supports FedProx's balance between local and global weights, aligning with previous rounds.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 2
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 2] ---
  - Reasoning: To improve client performance, I recommend adjusting the hyperparameters based on the historical performance and characteristics of clients. Given that Client 2 has a high capacity and can handle larger batch sizes, I suggest maintaining a batch size of 64 as it’s the upper limit that has yielded better results for clients. The learning rate was previously set at 0.006; I recommend slightly increasing it to 0.007 to explore a more aggressive training approach and see if it improves convergence. The weight decay remains at 5e-05 as it did not hinder performance in the last epoch while stabilizing training. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' is wise since it performed well for Client 2 and aligns with other peer results. The local_epochs stay at 1 since increasing it hasn't shown benefit in past comparisons, while the dropout rate is set to 0.3, slightly higher to encourage better generalization. The server can benefit from a slight increase in its learning rate to 0.005, given that Client 27 performed well using a higher baseline. For the server's optimizer, I choose 'SGD' since it's standard and generally works well for well-structured models. A 'StepLR' scheduler provides a structured learning rate decay schedule that can aid convergence over epochs. Finally, I recommend keeping the mu at 0.01 to balance the influence of local updates and maintain stability in federated learning scenarios.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 10] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high-resource capacity of Client 10, an increase in learning rate and batch size compared to its previous configurations might yield better results. Client 10's previous learning rate was 0.007 with a test accuracy of 62.27%. The peer with the best performance (Client 2 with 74.60%) employed a learning rate of 0.007, so we can try a slightly higher learning rate of 0.008 to encourage faster convergence. The selected batch size is 128 to leverage the client's power. Weight decay remains at 5e-05, as it has shown stability across peers. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW' as it has provided productive results. The dropout rate is adjusted to 0.2, which is less than the highest case seen, to prevent overfitting while ensuring a robust model for this specific dataset. The local epochs remain at 1 as per the previous context. On the server side, I recommend a learning rate of 0.005, leveraging a moderate learning rate to balance convergence and stability. The server will also use 'SGD', as it tends to perform well for final layers in deep learning architectures. A simple schedule like 'StepLR' is good for gradual learning adjustments. Finally, we can maintain `mu` at 0.01 since it is consistently yielding results across clients and aids in regularization without over-smoothing.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 36.70% indicates that the model may not be effectively learning from the data, suggesting that the search space for hyperparameters may need adjustment for better exploration. I recommend increasing the batch size and adjusting the learning rate to encourage better convergence. Additionally, less aggressive dropout may improve the model's ability to retain learned features.

  Client 10, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 81.83%, Test Acc 57.88%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 8
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 8] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the client history, we see that the maximum test accuracy achieved was 74.60% by a peer client with similar parameters but a slightly different learning rate and batch size. This suggests the potential for improvement by modifying the learning rate and considering increasing the batch size for better performance. Since Client 8 is a high-resource client, a larger batch size of 128 can be utilized for efficient training. Adjusting the learning rate to 0.007 may also help in balancing convergence speed and stability, considering its history of achieving results up to 74.60% by other clients. Maintaining `weight_decay` at 5e-05 appears beneficial as clients using this have performed better, while keeping `momentum` consistent at 0.9 aids in smoother convergence. The optimizer `AdamW` has shown consistent results across peers, so it remains unchanged. The scheduler `CosineAnnealingLR` can continue, as it helps in adapting the learning rate throughout the training process. The local epochs are set at 1 as per the context. A dropout rate of 0.2 is suggested, as it has been effective in prior configurations.

For the server's hyperparameters, a learning rate of 0.003 is adopted to maintain stability for the remaining model, while using SGD seems suitable given the constraints set forth by the peers' setups. The momentum of 0.9 is retained to ensure continuity in training dynamics. The scheduler for the server is also set to `StepLR`, which offers a structured approach to adjusting the learning rate. For the mu parameter used in FedProx for regularization, it remains at 0.01, as this has been a consistent value across peer setups without negative impacts on accuracy. Overall, these choices are aimed at maintaining a balance between convergence speed and performance across both client and server roles.

  - LLM Reasoning: The test accuracy is relatively low at 62.85%, indicating that the model may benefit from a wider hyperparameter exploration in terms of learning rates and batch sizes. Given that this client can handle larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates, I will increase the maximum learning rate for the client as well as test larger batch sizes. Additionally, I will suggest exploring different optimizers to see if they can improve performance.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 17
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 17] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the constraints of Cluster 0's low-resource clients, I recommend a set of hyperparameters that prioritize stability and cautious training progress. The learning rate is set to 0.0003, the upper limit of the available search space, which provides enough room for updates without leading to instability. The weight decay is adjusted to 1e-06 to help regularize the training without being overly aggressive. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 since this setting has already demonstrated improved accuracy in previous epochs. For optimization, I suggest continuing with 'AdamW' due to its adaptive nature, which can be beneficial for lower-resource clients. The scheduler is kept as 'None' since no effective learning rate adjustments were indicated as necessary from previous epochs. The local epochs remain at the minimum of 1 to ensure efficient training on the limited resources available to this client. The batch size is set to 16, which is compatible with low-resource settings and previously used. The dropout rate is increased to 0.2 to potentially enhance generalization. 

For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected to allow for manageable updates in the deeper layers of the model. Still, this is within the range that balances learning speed and stability for a more complex model. The momentum is also kept at 0.9 to ensure that we retain the benefits seen from prior settings. Here, I recommend using 'SGD' as it is typically advantageous for deeper networks especially when paired with a StepLR scheduler for potential learning rate decay to reinforce convergence over epochs. For the mu parameter, I suggest retaining it at 0.01 to sustain a balance between client and server contributions, as it previously served well.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 3
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 3] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 3 is a low-resource client and has shown improvements in accuracy with nonlinear adjustments, we are opting for a learning rate of 0.0003, which balances stability and convergence potential while staying below the previously tested optimal range. The weight decay is set to 5e-07 to further reduce overfitting risk, considering the complexity and scope of the dataset. The momentum is kept at 0.9, as it has been effective in previous attempts. We will continue using the AdamW optimizer for its adaptive learning capabilities. Since local epochs can only be set to 1, we will maintain that. The batch size of 16 caters to memory constraints while encompassing enough data for training. The dropout rate is increased to 0.2 to promote generalization and combat potential overfitting given the previous performance. 

For the server, we will continue with the SGD optimizer, selecting a learning rate of 0.002 to facilitate a steady convergence toward improving the overall model accuracy. A momentum of 0.9 remains apt for handling the deeper layers of the model. The use of StepLR for the scheduler has proven useful in obtaining stability through learning rate scheduling. Lastly, mu is retained at 0.01, aligning with prior settings that facilitated balanced regularization without excessively penalizing the loss.

  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource capacity of Client ID 24, the hyperparameters should prioritize stability and controlled learning to maintain performance. In the past epochs, the client performed best with a lower learning rate of 0.0001, which aligns with the trend of achieving higher test accuracy after adjusting for lower values. The weight decay is set to 1e-05 to help prevent overfitting while still providing sufficient regularization. Keeping `momentum` at 0.9 supports accelerated convergence without overshooting. The optimizer remains `AdamW`, as it has offered good performance historically, and we opt for `None` as the scheduler to simplify training due to resource constraints. Local epochs are retained at 1, and a smaller `batch_size` of 16 is employed to avoid memory overload. Lastly, the dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.2 to enhance generalization while remaining cautious of the overfitting risk, evident from previous results.

For the server, we keep the learning rate at 0.001, which demonstrated effective aggregation in earlier trials. The momentum is kept at 0.9 for consistent performance. The optimizer will use `SGD`, as it may benefit the server to balance complexity with convergence efficiently. The scheduler will be set to `StepLR`, allowing for optimization of the learning rate over time to prevent divergence during training. Finally, `mu` is maintained at 0.01, ensuring a controlled effect of the FedProx regularization on the server's updates.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client is operating at a low-resource capacity and has a relatively low accuracy. This could be improved by adjusting the learning rate and the batch size to allow for better training stability. Lowering the learning rate can help in fine-tuning the learning process, while reducing the batch size can lead to more updates per epoch, which is beneficial for a low-capacity client.

  - Reasoning: Based on the context provided, the primary goal is to optimize hyperparameters for a low-resource client using Split Federated Learning. Given the client's history and the performance trends observed from previous epochs and peer clients, the hyperparameters have been selected to provide stability and room for improvement. The following considerations were made:
- **Learning Rate:** A slightly higher learning rate (0.0003) is chosen compared to last epoch's best (0.0001) to potentially escape local minima while still considering the low-resource capacity. Lower extreme values risk lack of learning.
- **Weight Decay:** Set to 1e-05, this is an optimal middle-ground value to prevent overfitting but still allow for weight updates during the training. It aligns with successful past configurations.
- **Momentum:** Retained at 0.9 as this value has been effective in past experiments, providing smoother updates to the gradients.
- **Optimizer:** AdamW has shown great results, providing adaptive learning rates, which should help with a smoother learning process, especially on the client's local data.
- **Scheduler:** 'None' is kept since no learning rate decay schedule was previously applied. This approach could stabilize learning for the low-resource client.
- **Local Epochs:** Remains at 1 to keep resources low while focusing on increased training quality with other HPs.
- **Batch Size:** Maintained at 16; the low-resource capacity necessitates smaller batch sizes to prevent out-of-memory errors and maintain stability.
- **Dropout Rate:** Increased to 0.2 to improve generalization capability, following the success seen with similar dropout rates in other peers.

On the server side, while the server runs a deeper model, a corresponding learning rate of 0.001 is adequate, balancing the complexity of the remaining network layers. The server will use SGD to leverage its stability in training deeper layers, with a momentum value of 0.9 maintaining consistency. The StepLR scheduler helps in slowly reducing the learning rate, potentially aiding the server in more effective convergence.

Finally, the mu value is maintained at 0.01 to observe the effects of FedProx regularization which aligns with previous experiments, balancing the influence of local models and the global model.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 22] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the client's low-resource category and the provided histories, we need to set hyperparameters that ensure stable training while trying to maintain or improve accuracy. The previous accuracy of 96.14% with a learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 1e-06, and batch size of 16 suggests these are reasonable starting points. However, to accommodate the low-resource constraints, we can try slightly adjusting the learning rate and using the same optimizer (AdamW) for better convergence over epochs while keeping the batch size small. 

- **Learning Rate**: I suggest slightly increasing it to 0.0003 to enhance convergence based on some peers while still being cautious given the low-resource nature. 
- **Weight Decay**: Keeping it at 1e-06 maintains regularization without over-penalizing the weights, allowing for greater learning around diverse data.
- **Momentum**: Sticking to 0.9, which has shown stable convergence across various clients.
- **Optimizer**: AdamW is preferable as it handles sparse gradients effectively, which may help stabilize training in low-resource settings.
- **Scheduler**: No scheduler is specified for the client; setting to 'None' simplifies training for the low-resource client.
- **Local Epochs**: Continuing with 1 ensures quick iterations, which is important for low-resource clients that may struggle with prolonged training.
- **Batch Size**: Maintaining it at 16 continues to adhere to low-resource constraints while maximizing gradient update stability given fewer samples per update.
- **Dropout Rate**: Increasing slightly to 0.2, which may help in regularizing the network and potentially improving model generalization. 

For the server, which involves more complex computations (running deeper layers), increasing the server's learning rate to 0.002 can help reduce loss more rapidly. Maintain the server optimizer as SGD, as it has shown better performance for larger-scale tasks. Using a step scheduler helps to adapt the learning rate progressively.

Finally, keeping mu at 0.01 strikes a balance; it allows some level of Prox regularization to ensure clients don’t drift too far from global model parameters given the system's inherent varying capabilities.

  - Reasoning: Given that this client is categorized as having medium-resource capacity and is processing the MNIST dataset using the ResNet18 model, the hyperparameters must consider both performance and resource efficiency. For the client's learning rate, a value of 0.001 was chosen as it provides a good balance between learning speed and stability. A weight decay of 1e-04 helps in regularizing the model without being overly restrictive. The momentum of 0.9 is standard and will help in accelerating gradients in the relevant direction while smoothing out updates. The 'AdamW' optimizer is chosen due to its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities, making it well-suited for clients with moderate resources. A batch_size of 32 strikes a good balance between training speed and memory usage. As this is the first round for the client, keeping local_epochs at 1 ensures that it does not overfit or excessively drain resources. A dropout_rate of 0.1 is applied to help prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server side, the learning rate is set to 0.005, slightly higher to account for the deeper architecture, which can benefit from faster convergence. The SGD optimizer is employed because it is well suited for larger models and provides consistent performance. A momentum of 0.9 is maintained for stability in updates, and the scheduler is set to None since the server is processing additional layers that may not require a schedule at this stage. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 is included to provide regularization to the fed model, helping to control the influence of local updates across clients.

  - Reasoning: Based on the previous performances and peer history, I assessed the effectiveness of various hyperparameters. For the client, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 seems optimal given that both the last accuracy (94.91%) and the peer performance suggest no adverse effects from a learning rate at this level. Lowering the learning rate to 0.0005 would be less beneficial given the improvement achieved at 0.001. Keeping the weight decay at its current low value (1e-05) is prudent as it had a minimal impact while helping to avoid overfitting. I will keep the momentum at 0.9, matching both the client’s and peers' successful implementations. The AdamW optimizer, which generally performs better for adaptive optimization contexts, will be retained. The use of the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is retained as it helps manage learning effectively throughout the epochs. Keeping `local_epochs` to 1 is necessary and ensuring a `batch_size` of 32 is ideal for the capacity of a medium-resource client, balancing training speed and convergence. The dropout rate can remain at 0.2 to prevent overfitting but can be slightly increased based on peer performance to 0.3, aiming for better regularization. 

On the server side, I recommend a learning rate of 0.005, compared to the client's, since a slightly faster rate may facilitate the training of the deeper model layers. Like the client, the server will also have a momentum of 0.9 to maintain consistency and stability during optimization. Using the SGD optimizer is better for the server’s task given its simplicity in handling gradients in such architectures. The scheduler remains as StepLR to adjust the learning rate effectively over epochs. I will retain mu at 0.01 to balance the regularization against the federated learning objectives.

  - Reasoning: The client's previous epochs showed increasing test accuracies with adjustments to hyperparameters. Given that the client is in a medium-resource cluster, it is important to balance performance with resource usage. Based on peer history, the use of a learning rate of 0.001 had been effective for Client 18, suggesting potential fine-tuning. The weight decay was kept moderate to prevent overfitting while still encouraging generalization. The optimizer 'AdamW' has shown promising results in both client and peer cases, so it was retained. To experiment with potential improvements, the batch size was increased to 64 to utilize available resources more efficiently, and a small dropout rate of 0.2 was maintained for regularization without excessively complicating training. On the server side, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.006 is a middle ground based on the previous server learning rates observed while still allowing sufficient room for exploration. While the optimizer remains 'SGD' for its efficiency in deep learning tasks, a 'StepLR' scheduler was chosen for possibly improved learning rate adaptation over epochs. The value of mu was retained at 0.01 to maintain a consistent FedProx regularization strength. This configuration maintains a good balance of exploration and exploitation based on historical data.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 10
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 10] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for the client, I observed that the previous configurations resulted in a significant variance in test accuracy, indicating that tuning is required. Given the client's capacity as a high-resource client, I opted for larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates. Specifically, I chose a learning rate of 0.009 to slightly increase from prior attempts while staying comfortably within the range. A weight decay of 5e-05 provides a balance for generalization without being too restrictive. Given that the momentum has been consistently set at 0.9 and has shown promise, I retained this setting. I selected 'AdamW' as the optimizer to retain flexibility in handling learning dynamics, while the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is maintained to adjust the learning rate effectively over epochs. To enhance learning stability, I retained 2 local epochs and increased the batch size to 256, providing ample data in each update iteration, and raised the dropout rate to 0.15 to prevent overfitting during local training. The server hyperparameters are configured with a learning rate of 0.005, a momentum of 0.9, and 'SGD' as the optimizer, as these settings have historically supported gradual model improvements. A 'StepLR' scheduler is recommended to allow significant learning rate adjustments at predefined intervals, enhancing convergence for the deeper layers on the server side. Lastly, a regularization parameter (mu) of 0.01 is suggested, aligning with previous runs and providing a reasonable balance for FedProx regularization.
