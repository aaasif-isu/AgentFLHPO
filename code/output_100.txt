  - Reasoning: Given that this client belongs to a low-resource cluster (Cluster 0), the hyperparameters need to be carefully selected to ensure stable training despite limited computational resources. This means opting for smaller values for the learning rate, batch size, and potentially fewer epochs. 

1. **Learning Rate**: I recommend a learning rate of **0.001**. It's a moderate value that provides a balance between convergence speed and stability under low resource conditions. 
2. **Weight Decay**: A value of **1e-05** is suitable as it is low enough to prevent overfitting without placing too heavy a penalty on weights, which could hinder learning in a small batch. 
3. **Momentum**: I chose **0.9** for momentum, as this helps to accelerate the SGD optimizer in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations, thus aiding convergence without requiring excessively large batch sizes. 
4. **Optimizer**: I selected **AdamW** for optimization as it generally works well with smaller learning rates and has better handling of various data distributions, which is particularly beneficial given the client is new and has no prior history. 
5. **Scheduler**: A **CosineAnnealingLR** scheduler is employed which gradually reduces the learning rate, allowing adaptability during the training phase. 
6. **Local Epochs**: I set it to **1** since lower epoch counts prevent long training sessions that can exacerbate resource issues. 
7. **Batch Size**: A batch size of **16** is appropriate for low-resource settings to avoid memory overload while still allowing for meaningful gradient estimations. 
8. **Dropout Rate**: I recommend using a **dropout rate** of **0.2** to enhance regularization and help the model generalize better despite limited training data. 

On the server side, since the server is responsible for more complex layers, I opted for a slightly higher learning rate of **0.005** to facilitate effective training, which can be compensated for with momentum. 
1. **Momentum**: I selected **0.9**, maintaining consistency in momentum to ensure coherent updates and effective training. 
2. **Optimizer**: Using **SGD** on the server is appropriate given the increased complexity it faces during training, and it generally increases convergence speed when managing sophisticated architectures. 
3. **Scheduler**: I chose **StepLR**, which allows for a controlled and stepwise reduction of the learning rate, adapting well to the training demands over time. 

'**Mu** is set at **0.01** to maintain a moderate level of FedProx regularization, ensuring the model remains stable during training on both the client and server sides.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client displayed low test accuracy, indicating instability in training possibly due to high learning rates and inadequate capacity to handle batch sizes. Thus, I will lower the learning rate for both client and server, decrease the batch size, and try a smaller weight decay to stabilize training.

  - Reasoning: The client is identified as a low-resource client, which requires careful selection of hyperparameters to ensure stable training. For the learning rate, a smaller value is chosen (0.001) to facilitate smoother updates given the client's weaker capacity. The weight decay is set to a small value (1e-05) to prevent overfitting without heavily penalizing the training process. Due to the low resource status of the client, the momentum is set at 0.9, which is common for optimizers like AdamW while still providing a slight inertial benefit. The optimizer is chosen as 'AdamW' for its adaptive learning capabilities which aligns well with low-resource clients. The learning scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected to help periodically adjust the learning rate, further stabilizing training across the round. Given this is the first round and recognizing the client's limitations, the local epochs are set to 1 to avoid excessive resource usage. A batch size of 16 is chosen based on the client being in a low-resource category to facilitate training with minimal memory requirements. The dropout rate is set at 0.2 to introduce regularization and prevent overfitting, considering the model’s complexity. For the server side, given that the server runs the deeper part of the model, a learning rate of 0.005 is selected, which is slightly higher than the client's to account for the capacity differences and complexity of the remaining model layers. The server optimizer is 'SGD' since it generally works better for larger models like the one running on the server. A momentum of 0.9 is adopted for increased stability in convergence. Lastly, a step learning rate scheduler is implemented to adjust the learning rate at specific intervals. The mu value is set to 0.01 to incorporate regularization for the federated learning process while limiting the impact of client discrepancies.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client's final test accuracy of 29.95% indicates that the model is likely struggling to converge properly, especially given its low-resource constraints. To improve stability and performance, I will reduce the learning rate and batch size for the client while exploring lower dropout rates. Furthermore, a modification to the optimizer settings might help, as AdamW may not be optimal under low-resource circumstances.

  - Reasoning: Given the specifications for the client in a split federated learning setting, a balanced approach is necessary to optimize performance without overloading the medium-resource client. For the learning rate, a value of 0.001 is a safe starting point that allows for effective updates while mitigating potential oscillations during training. The weight decay of 5e-05 ensures regularization to prevent overfitting. A momentum of 0.9 is a standard choice that can help accelerate SGD in the relevant direction while dampening oscillations. The AdamW optimizer is good for general purposes and provides adaptive learning rates, making it suitable for the client's moderate capacity. The CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is selected for its ability to adjust the learning rate over epochs, which can lead to better convergence in iterative training. Since this is the client's first round of training, setting local_epochs to 2 allows for sufficient learning without excessive computational demands, and a batch size of 32 strikes a balance between model accuracy and memory utilization. A dropout rate of 0.2 helps in regularization without excessively degrading learning capacity.

For the server, a learning rate of 0.005 is recommended, as the server handles deeper layers with more parameters, requiring slightly more aggressive parameter updates compared to the client. Keeping momentum at 0.9 is consistent with the client, ensuring harmony in training dynamics. The SGD optimizer is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in convergence when training deep models on distributed setups. Lastly, utilizing a StepLR scheduler allows more control for the server's updates, facilitating tuned learning during training. The chosen `mu` value of 0.01 balances between local training and centralized adaptation, ensuring regularization of the splits in federated learning.

  Client 14, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 72.83%, Test Acc 40.75%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 31
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 31] ---
  - Reasoning: In this round, Client 31 has moderate computational capacity and is targeting to achieve good accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet18 in a Split Federated Learning setup. The selection of the hyperparameters is influenced primarily by the peer's successful configurations. Notably, Client 14 achieved a relatively low accuracy (36.45%) with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001, suggesting room for tuning. 

For the client-side, we can retain the batch size of 32 as it aligns with medium resource clients and check for improved parameters. The learning rate has been chosen as 0.002 to provide slightly more aggressive convergence than 0.001 while still being safe. A weight decay of 0.0001 is selected to prevent overfitting, and a momentum of 0.9 is consistent with common practices. Opting for the 'AdamW' optimizer instead of SGD may yield better results given that its adaptive properties can help in training the initial layers of the ResNet model. A local epoch count of 2 allows enough training time without overwhelming the client's resources. Meanwhile, a dropout rate of 0.2 is included to promote robustness in the training process.

For the server-side, the learning rate is set to 0.005, which is a moderate compromise between stability and convergence speed, suitable for deeper models. The optimizer remains SGD, consistent with validation across federated learning server practices. The choice of StepLR as a scheduler helps in reducing the learning rate at fixed intervals, which can be beneficial for convergence dynamics.

The `mu` parameter is set to 0.01, following a common value derived from observed practices with FedProx regularization, which can balance global updates and local fitting effectively.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 28.67% indicates that the model's performance is quite low, suggesting potential issues with the learning rate and batch size. I will reduce the learning rate for the client to enhance learning dynamics and increase the batch size to allow more stable updates. Additionally, I'll consider changing the optimizer to check if a different optimization strategy can yield better results.

  Client 31, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 50.06%, Test Acc 31.03%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 17
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 17] ---
  - Reasoning: In this split federated learning setting with ResNet18 on CIFAR10, we aim to find optimal hyperparameters for the client and server while considering the client's capacity. Given that this is the client's first run and they belong to a medium-resource cluster, it's essential to pick parameters that balance training efficiency and model convergence. 

For the client, leveraging insights from peer history (especially Client 14, who achieved a 36.45% accuracy) is helpful. Both peers have chosen a `learning_rate` of 0.001 and a `weight_decay` of 5e-05 or 1e-05. Since this client has moderate capacity, a `batch_size` of 32 is reasonable. A `local_epochs` setting of 2 is optimal for sufficient training without overwhelming the resources. Similarly, `dropout_rate` of 0.2 is suitable to avoid overfitting while ensuring effective training. The choice of optimizer will be 'AdamW' given its adaptive learning capabilities, which is beneficial for less experienced clients. 

For the server, a simpler optimizer configuration is advisable given the model's complexity and split. Hence, 'SGD' with a lower `learning_rate` of 0.005 can maintain the stability of parameters across the last layers. The chosen `momentum` of 0.9 and the `StepLR` scheduler will facilitate systematic decay in learning, which aids in the convergence process of the server model. Finally, a 'mu' value of 0.01 is reasonable, considering the performance of previous clients, as it regularizes the client updates while still allowing sufficient learning from local data.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 34.12% indicates suboptimal performance, suggesting the need for hyperparameter refinement. Reducing the learning rates may help with convergence, while experimenting with batch size may yield better results by providing more stable gradient updates. Increasing the dropout rate could also help in reducing overfitting. Additionally, changing the optimizer from AdamW to a more robust alternative could improve performance.

  Client 17, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 74.43%, Test Acc 29.66%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 13
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 13] ---
  - Reasoning: Considering the client's medium-resource capacity, a moderate set of hyperparameters has been chosen to optimize training without overwhelming the client. The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a standard choice for AdamW and is likely to facilitate convergence without causing instability. The weight decay is set at 5e-05, reflecting a common practice to prevent overfitting without affecting generalization significantly. Momentum is kept at 0.9 to accelerate convergence while providing some stability during training. The AdamW optimizer is chosen since it generally works well with neural networks and is suitable for CIFAR-10 tasks. A cosine annealing scheduler allows the learning rate to adapt dynamically, improving the training over the two local epochs, which is the maximum permitted. The batch size is set at 32, balancing training time and memory usage effectively. The dropout rate is chosen at 0.2 to mitigate potential overfitting while allowing sufficient capacity for learning on a small dataset like CIFAR-10.
 
For the server, the learning rate is also set at 0.005 under the assumption that the server model may require a slightly higher rate to manage the gradient updates from multiple clients. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain consistency with the client’s optimization strategy. The SGD optimizer is selected for the server side, which is generally more straightforward and often provides better performance on larger models in federated learning scenarios. StepLR is used as a scheduler to manage the learning rate during training systematically. 

Lastly, mu is set to 0.01 as a starting point after observation from peers indicates this value may work effectively in controlling the proximal term that adjusts for deviations in the federated setup.

  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters for the client take into account the high-resource capability of Cluster 2. A larger batch size of 128 is chosen, allowing the client to utilize its resources effectively. The learning rate is set at 0.002, which is a common starting point for training models like ResNet18. Weight decay is chosen at 0.0005 to help with regularization without overly penalizing the model weights. A momentum of 0.9 is selected to speed up optimization. The optimizer 'AdamW' is appropriate given its regularization properties and efficiency in training deep learning models. 'CosineAnnealingLR' is used as the scheduler to allow for a gradual reduction in learning rate, enhancing convergence towards later epochs. I selected 2 local epochs for sufficient training within this round and set a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting, especially since this is the client's first round.

For the server, the deeper model configuration benefits from a smaller learning rate of 0.001, promoting stable convergence.  Momentum is kept at 0.9 for consistency with the client and works well in many cases. The server uses 'SGD' as the optimizer for its simplicity and efficacy in optimizing deep networks. A 'StepLR' scheduler is chosen for its predictable adjustment of the learning rate.

For the mu parameter, a value of 0.01 is selected based on typical balances in federated learning scenarios that help manage the regularization effect effectively without dampening learning on the client too much.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 94
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 94] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for client 94 and considering the performance of client 3, we need to select hyperparameters that balance aggressiveness and stability. For the client, a learning rate of 0.002 is a good starting point, slightly higher than client 3 to encourage quick learning while maintaining stability. A weight decay of 0.0005 is chosen to prevent overfitting without being too restrictive. The momentum is set to 0.9, offering a good trade-off between convergence speed and oscillation. The optimizer is 'AdamW' since it generally performs better with a small number of epochs and can handle sparse gradients well. For the scheduler, 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected to allow a gradual, adaptive decrease in the learning rate. The number of local epochs is set to 2 for effectively utilizing available data, and a batch size of 128 is chosen to maximize resource utilization on the high-capacity client. A dropout rate of 0.2 helps generalize the model without excessively reducing complexity.

On the server side, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen to maintain stability with the deeper layers of the ResNet18 model while still allowing for sufficient updates. A momentum of 0.9 complements the SGD optimizer by smoothing the updates. Selecting 'SGD' ensures a consistent updating strategy, commonly used in conjunction with a lower learning rate for deeper architectures. The 'StepLR' scheduler is employed here to adjust the learning rate at regular intervals, which is a standard approach for training deeper models. Setting mu to 0.01 offers a moderate level of regularization for FedProx, allowing the server to balance between local updates and the global model during training.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 34.06% suggests that the current hyperparameter values are not well-suited for the ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10. Since the client has a high-capacity cluster, we can afford to increase the batch size to improve training stability and explore higher learning rates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, reducing the dropout rate may help mitigate underfitting, as the current dropout might be too aggressive for this model architecture.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 86] ---
  - Reasoning: The client's capacity is high, allowing for larger batch sizes and a more aggressive learning rate. Based on the peer history, a batch size of 128 is reasonable, as it aligns with successful configurations from clients 3 and 94. Previous client HPs also highlighted a learning rate of 0.002, which balances speed and stability, making it appropriate for the target model, ResNet18. The weight decay of 0.0005 is selected to prevent overfitting while not being overly aggressive. Using 'AdamW' as the optimizer is favorable as it has been successful in previous attempts. A cosine annealing schedule aids in fostering convergence with an appropriate learning rate decay. Setting local epochs to 2 allows for sufficient training without overfitting. A dropout rate of 0.2 will help generalize the model effectively without extreme dropout that might hinder learning. 

For the server-side, a learning rate of 0.001 is common for fine-tuning, allowing for stable updates particularly for more complex areas of the model. A momentum of 0.9 is a solid choice to help accelerate SGD in relevant directions while smoothing the updates. Using 'SGD' is sensible for server-side optimization given its iterative convergence characteristics, especially with simple schedulers like 'StepLR' which allows structured updates. The mu parameter is set to 0.01, which provides a balance between local and global learning, ensuring that local models learn effectively without deviating too much from the global model.

  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters consider the low-resource nature of the client and the requirements of the split federated learning setup. For the client: a lower learning rate of 0.001 ensures stability during the first training round. A weight decay of 1e-04 helps prevent overfitting, which is crucial for limited computational resources. A momentum of 0.9 is chosen to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, ensuring faster convergence. The 'SGD' optimizer is more stable for low-resource training scenarios than 'AdamW', which may require more computational power. A small batch size of 16 takes into account the limitations of the client, ensuring efficient memory usage while still allowing enough data to stabilize the gradient updates. Local epochs are set to 1 as it's the client's first training round and limitations should be considered. A moderate dropout rate of 0.2 helps prevent overfitting while being manageable within the low-resource environment. In terms of the server settings, a learning rate of 0.005 is chosen to balance the complexity of the deeper model and the need for effective training. The server continues using the 'SGD' optimizer as well, which is consistent throughout the architecture for simplicity and compatibility with the client-side. The momentum is also set to 0.9 for similar reasons. Lastly, a 'StepLR' scheduler effectively adjusts the learning rate over time, which can help maintain steady training progress. The mu parameter is set at 0.01, providing a moderate level of FedProx regularization to help manage the divergence in client training despite their resource constraints.

  - Reasoning: Given that the client is part of a low-resource cluster and this is their first round of training, it is important to choose hyperparameters that promote stability and facilitate learning effectively. The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is moderate and should provide enough stability for the client without risking divergence. The weight decay is set to a small value (1e-05) to prevent overfitting while acknowledging the client's capacity. A momentum of 0.9 is chosen to help accelerate convergence while not being too high. The optimizer is set to 'SGD', which is generally more stable for low-resource clients compared to 'AdamW'. A batch size of 16 is selected due to the client's low-resource context, allowing for effective memory use. The number of local epochs is set to 1 to prevent overfitting in the early training phase. The dropout rate is set to 0.2 to help regularize the model. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 is chosen, which is slightly higher than that of the client and should facilitate good convergence given the depth of the server model. The server will utilize 'SGD' as well to maintain consistency with the client while allowing beneficial updates from the clients to be integrated effectively. A 'StepLR' scheduler is applied on the server for effective learning rate adjustment over epochs. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is chosen for the FedProx regularization to balance merging client models while restraining the divergence of their updates.

  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource nature of Client 68, it is vital to select hyperparameters that ensure stability while maximizing training efficiency. Starting with the learning rate, a value of 0.001 is chosen to facilitate stable learning given the client's limitations. The weight decay is set to 1e-05 to encourage regularization while avoiding excessive penalization of the weights, which could hinder the learning process. A momentum of 0.9 is selected as it is a common choice for SGD that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging. The optimizer is set to 'SGD', as it is well-suited for low-resource environments and offers a straightforward implementation. Although the client capacity suggests some constraints, a batch size of 16 is selected to allow for more frequent updates without overwhelming the client’s limited memory. Local epochs are limited to 1 to keep computational demands low. For dropout rate, a value of 0.2 is chosen to help combat overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. The server, handling a more complex model, can utilize a learning rate of 0.005 to ensure it learns effectively from the representations provided by the client. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain stability, and the optimizer is again 'SGD' for consistency with the client's approach. The scheduler is set to 'StepLR', which allows the server to adjust the learning rate during training, optimizing convergence. The choice for `mu` is set to 0.01, striking a balance between encouraging collaboration and maintaining flexibility for the clients in light of their varying performance levels. This selection not only fosters a collaborative learning environment but also mitigates the impact of potential divergence among clients.

  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for client 58 in a Split Federated Learning setup using ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, we need to select hyperparameters that ensure stable learning without overwhelming the client's moderate resources. The client's capacity suggests using a moderate batch size and local epochs. Using AdamW as the optimizer is beneficial for handling potential sparse gradients, which is common in image datasets. A learning rate of 0.001 strikes a good balance between fast convergence and stability. For local epochs, setting it to 2 allows for more updates without risking overfitting due to limited data. The weight decay is set to 1e-04 to help regularize the model. Dropout is added at 0.2 to assist with generalization. On the server side, since the server will handle the deeper layers of the model, a learning rate of 0.003 is selected to accommodate more complex gradient dynamics. SGD is chosen for its stability in training deep networks, and the momentum is set at 0.9 to help accelerate gradients. The StepLR scheduler aids in adjusting the learning rate during training, ensuring a smoother convergence. Finally, a `mu` of 0.01 is suggested for the FedProx regularization, providing a balanced trade-off between local training and federated alignment.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy is low at 24.50%, indicating that the model is either underfitting or the hyperparameter choices are not optimal. It's important to explore a wider range of learning rates and adjust the batch size to improve performance. The learning rate for the client can be reduced and the learning rate for the server can be increased. Additionally, I will explore options for the optimizer and dropout rate to enable a better fitting of the model.

  Client 58, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 83.48%, Test Acc 27.29%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 17
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 17] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting the hyperparameters for the client and server, several important considerations were taken into account based on the provided context and history. For the client, the learning rate was kept at the higher end of the available range, specifically 0.0005. This choice reflects an adaptation to improve learning stability after poor performance in the previous round (34.12% accuracy) and in light of client 58's noticeably lower accuracy (24.50%) with a similar setup. A higher learning rate can potentially provide a more vigorous adjustment to the model weights, enhancing convergence. We chose a weight decay of 0.0001 from the refined search space to provide a mild regularization effect without overly penalizing the weights. The momentum is set to 0.9 to maintain a consistent update direction, recognizing that a high momentum often helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. While the optimizer is specified as Adam given its effective performance in many scenarios involving complex models like ResNet18, the dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.25, promoting better generalization amid moderate resources. The batch size is set to 32 and local epochs to 2, both aligning with the previously successful configuration while ensuring resource efficiency. Lastly, the scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for a dynamic learning rate adjustment during training.

On the server side, given its more complex task of tackling the last two layers of the model, we set the learning rate to 0.001 to enhance stable learning without overshooting optimal weights. The momentum remains at 0.9, with 'SGD' optimizer selected for its robustness in various settings. The scheduler is chosen as 'StepLR' to effectively manage learning rate decay at specified steps, which is crucial for the deeper layers of the network. The mu parameter is increased slightly to 0.02 from the previous value, as it controls the FedProx regularization, which we expect will help in reducing discrepancies caused by the split learning architecture, especially since the prior performance was suboptimal. This balance of hyperparameters reflects an orchestrated attempt to improve performance while considering the inherent limitations of this split federated setup.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 31
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 31] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that the client's previous configuration yielded a test accuracy of 28.67%, we need to introduce some adjustments in hyperparameters to improve performance. Moving towards the peer's settings that achieved a higher accuracy (like Client 17's settings at 36.77%) indicates a need for a lower learning rate and potentially different optimizers. The suggested client learning rate of 0.0005 is lower than the previous epoch's 0.002, which is a key change to help refine the model's performance. Additionally, we'll maintain the optimizer as 'AdamW' because it has shown favorable results in similar contexts. The batch size remains at 32 for balanced training, and we will keep local epochs at 2, given the moderate client capacity. The dropout rate is increased to 0.25 to potentially prevent overfitting and enhance generalization, aligned with peer performance. For the server, learning rate adjustments should support the deeper architecture, thus a higher value of 0.006 is set, accompanied by 'SGD' which is generally effective for deeper networks. A scheduler of 'StepLR' is selected to facilitate structured learning rate decay. Finally, `mu` is kept at 0.01 to maintain regularization balance as it proved sufficient previously. Overall, the configurations aim to harmonize between stability in learning and adaptability to the federated learning environment.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 18
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 18] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that the client has high computational resources, it can support larger batch sizes and potentially higher learning rates, which can accelerate convergence. The model being used, ResNet18, is relatively deep, and with CIFAR-10 being a comparatively simpler dataset, the learning rate can be set to a moderate value to allow for effective training without significant risk of divergence. A robust dropout rate helps prevent overfitting, and a small weight decay can provide additional regularization. The optimizer 'AdamW' is favored here for its adaptive learning capabilities, generally performing well with deeper models. For scheduling, 'CosineAnnealingLR' is beneficial as it allows more flexibility in learning rate adjustments. Hence, the chosen parameters are a mix of aggressive and stabilizing choices. On the server side, since the model is deeper (handling the last layer of ResNet18), a slightly lower learning rate can help ensure stability, and using 'SGD' with momentum can enhance convergence on a complex model. The regularization provided by FedProx, controlled by 'mu', is set to a moderate level to balance communication efficiency and model accuracy.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 33] ---
  - Reasoning: The choices for the hyperparameters are tailored to the client's high-resource context and the server's needs based on the characteristics of the task and peer performance. For the client's local training, a moderate learning rate of 0.005 is selected, which balances the need for exploration and convergence speed. A weight decay of 0.0005 is chosen to introduce regularization without overwhelming the optimization. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The 'AdamW' optimizer is preferred here due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which are valuable in high-capacity settings. The 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler ensures a smooth learning rate schedule, reducing the rate as training progresses. With 'local_epochs' set to 2, it allows for enough iterations without overfitting. A larger batch size of 128 is feasible for this high-resource client and helps stabilize the gradient estimates. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 strikes a good balance between regularization and model capacity. 

On the server side, I have selected a learning rate of 0.001, which is suitable for fine-tuning a complex model architecture and consistent with peer performance. The momentum remains at 0.9 for steady convergence, and 'SGD' is chosen for its robustness in deep learning applications. The 'StepLR' scheduler allows for effective learning rate decay at predefined intervals, optimizing the training process. The value of mu is set to 0.01 to moderate the influence of the differences in the client and server models while maintaining a reasonable balance on the regularization effect.

  - Reasoning: Considering the client's high-resource capability and the context of the prior peer performance, I opted for an aggressive yet manageable hyperparameter selection. The chosen learning rate is set to 0.005, which strikes a balance between rapid advancement and stability. A weight decay of 0.0001 is applied to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively. The momentum is kept at 0.9, leveraging momentum updates for better convergence speed. The 'AdamW' optimizer is selected based on its effectiveness in a high-resource environment, particularly for the ResNet architecture. For the scheduler, 'CosineAnnealingLR' is used, which can provide a smoother learning rate adjustment over time. The local epochs are set to 2 to ensure adequate model training on the client's data before submission, while the batch size is expanded to 256 to fully utilize the client's resources. A dropout rate of 0.2 is established to enhance generalization without excessively compromising model capacity. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen to accommodate for the deeper model's training dynamics, with SGD optimizer facilitating stable convergence. The momentum remains at 0.9, consistent with the client to maintain training coherence. For the scheduler, 'StepLR' is chosen to adjust the learning rate at specific intervals. Finally, I set mu to 0.01, ensuring appropriate regularization given the federated learning setup.

  - Reasoning: Given that Client 74 is a high-resource client and it's their first round of training, I will leverage more aggressive hyperparameters based on the performance of similar clients (Client 18, 33, and 71) in this epoch. The intimate use of the AdamW optimizer will likely provide better convergence speed, which is crucial for the client's learning dynamics. I choose 0.005 for the learning rate, balancing between enough responsiveness and stability in training. A weight decay of 0.0001 is selected to prevent overfitting but not so strict that it hampers learning, particularly given the regularization encouraged by FedProx. A batch size of 256 is chosen, maximizing resource utilization while enhancing statistical efficiency across local updates. The local epochs are set to 2 to strike a balance between learning depth without extensive local computation. A dropout rate of 0.2 is also included to mitigate overfitting occurrences. For the server, a similar learning rate of 0.005 is retained, with SGD selected as the optimizer for stability and effective management of server-side updates. The StepLR scheduler is chosen to gradually reduce the learning rate over time, aiding convergence. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 aligns the FedProx regularization effectively with the hyperparameters, maintaining a balance between fitting on local data and shared model coherence.

  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource nature of Client ID 2 in Cluster 0, the hyperparameters have been selected to ensure stable training without overwhelming the client’s resources. The learning rate is set to a low value of 0.001 to prevent divergence during this first round of training, which is critical for early stability. The weight decay is set to a low value of 1e-04 to control overfitting while still being manageable for low-resource clients. A momentum of 0.9 provides a good balance between speed and stability for SGD, while the AdamW optimizer is chosen for its adaptive learning rate that generally benefits low-resource workloads. The local epochs are set to 1 to reduce the training strain, and a batch size of 16 is selected to ensure that the client’s memory is not overwhelmed. Lastly, a modest dropout rate of 0.1 is included to help mitigate overfitting without significantly impacting the model's ability to learn. For the server, the learning rate is also kept to 0.001 as this model will be more complex due to more layers. The SGD optimizer is chosen to maintain consistency with the client side while using a momentum of 0.9 for efficient convergence. The 'None' scheduler is used as the model is already using low learning rates, reducing the complexity of tuning further. Finally, mu is set at 0.01 to ensure FedProx regularization is active but not overly constraining during the learning process.

  Client 2, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 59.03%, Test Acc 41.50%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 75
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 75] ---
  - Reasoning: Since the client (Cluster 0) has low resources, I've chosen hyperparameters that are conservative in terms of learning rate, batch size, and local epochs. The learning rate is set to 0.001, aligned with Client 2's successful performance. Weight decay is kept low (1e-05) to avoid excessive regularization, which can hinder learning in low-resource settings. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is commonly effective for stabilizing training. Given that the client is scaling their initial training, I've opted for only 1 local epoch and a batch size of 16, which should stabilize training further. The optimizer is chosen as 'AdamW', which is effective for low-resource scenarios, and no scheduler is implemented for simplicity. On the server side, using a learning rate of 0.005 strikes a balance between stability and learning efficacy, while also being higher than the client to account for its complex remaining layers. The server's optimizer is 'SGD' since it generally offers better convergence for deeper networks, and a scheduler like 'None' is selected at the moment for stability. A FedProx regularization value of mu=0.01 is used to balance the local and global updates given the lower client performance history.

  - Reasoning: Given the client operates with moderate resources and it is their first round of training, the selected hyperparameters aim to balance performance and resource constraints. The learning rate of 0.001 is a conservative choice that allows for stable training without overwhelming the model with large updates, which is especially critical for new clients. A batch size of 32 is selected to fit the medium resource category and ensure smooth gradients while avoiding excessive memory use. The local epochs are set to 2 to provide sufficient time for the model to learn from the local data without straining resources too much. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen for its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be beneficial for training complex models like ResNet18. A dropout rate of 0.3 is introduced to promote generalization and help prevent overfitting during training. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 is selected, which aligns well with the deeper layers needing a slightly faster learning speed but still under control. The momentum of 0.9 supports stable convergence in the optimization process, and the 'SGD' optimizer is appropriate given the typical practice when dealing with layers in server-side federated context. Finally, 'CosineAnnealingLR' is chosen as the scheduler for both client and server to adjust the learning rates dynamically based on the epoch progress. For FedProx, a mu value of 0.01 is set, as it provides a strong enough regularization to encourage local model alignment without compromising on the global performance too severely.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 41.80% indicates that the model may be underfitting or that the hyperparameters are not optimal for this dataset. I suggest increasing the learning rate for the client to allow for more aggressive weight updates and testing a larger batch size to improve the stability of the gradients. Additionally, reducing the dropout rate can help the model learn more from the training data.

  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters aim to balance performance and resource usage for a medium-capacity client in a Split Federated Learning environment. For the client, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as it's a common starting point that has shown effectiveness, especially considering this is the client's first round. A weight decay of 1e-05 is appropriate to prevent overfitting while not being too aggressive given the model architecture. The momentum is set to 0.9 to help maintain stability during updates. The optimizer selected is AdamW, which typically performs better for vision tasks and adapts learning rates effectively. The use of the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is useful for cyclic learning rates, allowing the optimizer to have decreasing learning rates that can aid in fine-tuning towards the end of epochs. Given the client capacity and Peer 29's configuration, local_epochs are set to 2 to ensure sufficient training without being too resource-heavy, while the batch size is set to 32 which is a moderate value. A dropout rate of 0.2 helps introduce regularization without losing too much model capacity.

For the server, a higher learning rate of 0.005 is chosen. Given that the server has a more complex model configuration (it processes the last two layers of ResNet18), a slightly larger learning rate can help in faster convergence. The momentum remains at 0.9 for consistency with the client. The optimizer is SGD, which is traditionally effective for training deep learning models, providing stability and performance gains. The scheduler is set to CosineAnnealingLR for a balanced approach to handling the server's training schedule.

Finally, the regularization parameter mu is set to 0.01, as this value is commonly effective in Federated Learning scenarios to maintain consistency across the clients' updates and counteract the potential discrepancies introduced by the federated learning environment.

  Client 80, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 84.19%, Test Acc 39.85%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 7
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 7] ---
  - Reasoning: To choose the hyperparameters for Client 7, we refer to the peer history and the search space constraints. Client 29 and Client 80 both opted for AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, weight decay of 1e-05, and a batch size of 32 with 2 local epochs, which produced reasonable accuracy. Given that this is the client's first round, it's prudent to start with similar parameters to validate performance effectiveness. The moderate capacity of Cluster 1 suggests sticking to a batch size of 32 as it balances performance without overwhelming the client resources. For dropout, it can be set to 0.3, aligning with the historical setup to prevent overfitting while allowing for some regularization. The mu value for FedProx can begin at 0.01, as it is effective without being overly restrictive. For the server, a slightly higher learning rate than the client could help because it's handling a more complex model, and this can be set to 0.005. SGD is also a suitable choice as it can converge well in such scenarios. The scheduler remains as CosineAnnealingLR which also appeared to be effective in the previous usages.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 49.83% suggests that model performance can be improved. Given the parameter settings, adjustments will be made to reduce the learning rates for both the client and server, and alter the batch size to support better convergence. Additionally, I will explore different optimizers to see if they can yield better results than the current settings.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 70
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 70] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is a high-resource client, I suggest selecting hyperparameters that maximize training efficiency and model performance. The chosen learning rate of 0.005 balances rapid convergence without overshooting the optimal solution. A weight decay of 0.0001 prevents overfitting while maintaining model generalization. A momentum value of 0.9 helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging. AdamW is selected as the optimizer due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which will enhance performance on the ResNet18 model, particularly on the CIFAR-10 benchmark. The CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is chosen as it allows the learning rate to fluctuate strategically throughout training, promoting exploration in the initial epochs and stabilizing towards convergence. Local epochs are set to 2 to allow enough updates during the federated round while not being excessively long. A batch size of 128 makes efficient use of the client's computational resources. A dropout rate of 0.3 helps regularize the model without significant performance loss. For the server-side, a learning rate of 0.003 is chosen to provide a more stable learning process since the server will not perform as many updates as the client due to the split federated model. The same momentum of 0.9 is suggested to help the server converge effectively. The SGD optimizer is used for its simplicity and effectiveness in high-level models like ResNet18. The StepLR scheduler will allow for periodic reductions in learning rate, facilitating convergence. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is selected to balance the FedProx regularization effect, encouraging the server and client models to stay aligned while promoting individual learning. This combination should lead to a well-rounded training process across both the client and server in this split learning scenario.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 28
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 28] ---
  - Reasoning: After analyzing the previous performance metrics and the search space restrictions, I chose hyperparameters focused on maximizing the learning efficiency while balancing between the model's complexity and capacity. For the client side, I increased the `learning_rate` to 0.005, slightly below peer's usage to maintain stability while aiming for better results. Given the increased complexity of ResNet18, I opted for a `batch_size` of 128, which fits the high-resource client's capability, and `local_epochs` of 2 for more effective training per round. The `weight_decay` was set to 0.0001 to prevent overfitting without severely penalizing model weights. The `momentum` was left at 0.9, and I used `AdamW` as the optimizer due to its adaptive nature, which may result in better convergence. The `scheduler` is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow gradual learning rate adaptation and `dropout_rate` increased to 0.3 for better regularization and improved generalization. For the server side, I chose a `learning_rate` of 0.003, slightly lower than the client's, acknowledging the more complex base and needing finer adjustments for convergence. I retained `momentum` at 0.9 and selected `SGD` for optimizing the last layer as it's usually more effective in stochastic contexts. The `scheduler` is set to `StepLR` to implement staged learning rate decay. Finally, `mu` is kept at 0.01 based on consistent performance parameters, balancing regularization and adaptation across clients and server.

This indicates that we could be more aggressive with our learning rate. A learning rate of 0.006 is proposed, which is slightly higher than the previous clients yet still within the safe range. Weight decay is kept minimal at 0.0001 to prevent overfitting but still encourage generalization. Momentum remains at 0.9, as both previous clients found success with this value. The optimizer of choice will be 'AdamW,' which is known for its performance on these types of tasks. The batch size is increased to 256 to take advantage of the client's high capacity. A local epoch of 2 is set because the client can afford to make more updates before aggregating with the server. Finally, I suggest a dropout rate of 0.3, balancing robustness against overfitting while still providing enough capacity for effective training. For the server side, I suggest sticking with the same learning rate of 0.005 and momentum of 0.9 as success was observed with these settings. The optimizer remains 'SGD', and I recommend 'StepLR' as the scheduler to finely tune the server's learning process. The parameter mu is set to 0.01, aligning with the prior clients' settings, which provides a balanced regularization effect for the federated model.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 9
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 9] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for client 9 and they are in a high-resource cluster, we can afford to set more aggressive hyperparameters. Considering the peer history, a learning rate of 0.005 has been effective for some clients, so setting it slightly higher at 0.006 allows for faster convergence without excessive risk of divergence. With high-resource capacity, the batch size will be set to 256 to utilize the full capacity and potentially stabilize the gradients better during training. For weight decay, 0.0001 can help prevent overfitting, aligning with strategies observed in peer clients. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen for its efficiency in training deep networks like ResNet18. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is great for dynamic learning rate adjustments throughout training. Dropout rate is set to 0.3 based on peer usage, balancing regularization and learning capacity as found in ResNet models. Setting local epochs to 2 allows for adequate training on local data before sending updates. For the server, the learning rate of 0.005 strikes a good balance as seen with successful peer performance, and using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 aligns with common practices for server-side training, particularly with multiple layers. I chose 'StepLR' for the server scheduler to allow periodic learning rate adjustments to avoid stagnation. A 'mu' of 0.01 is selected, as it has been effective for managing the trade-off between local and global updates, maintaining a reasonable regularization framework.

  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource capacity of this client in Cluster 0, we chose a small batch size and a lower learning rate to ensure that the client can train stably without running into resource constraints. A batch size of 16 is more suitable for limited memory, allowing for more frequent updates while controlling variance in the stochastic gradient. The learning rate of 0.001 is a conservative choice that typically works well with ResNet architectures, especially for initial training steps. We opted for the 'AdamW' optimizer due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which can lead to better convergence in a resource-constrained environment. A local epoch value of 2 ensures that the model gets sufficient training without overwhelming the client resources. A small weight decay of 1e-05 helps to regularize the model while minimizing overfitting, critical in low-data scenarios. The dropout rate of 0.2 provides an additional layer of regularization. For the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 is selected to balance the complexity of the deeper model while still utilizing the 'SGD' optimizer, which is often preferred for training with more substantial and complex architectures. We set the momentum at 0.9 to help stabilize updates. The 'StepLR' scheduler can adapt the learning rate throughout training, accommodating the server’s deeper model while supporting eventual convergence. Meanwhile, for `mu`, we’ve selected a mid-range value of 0.01 to promote stability in Federated Learning while also introducing a moderate level of regularization to account for heterogeneity across clients.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 72] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this client is classified as low-resource, the hyperparameters need to be conservative to ensure stable training. Taking clues from client 76's performance, I will opt for a low `learning_rate` and `batch_size` to reduce resource consumption and increase stability. A learning rate of 0.001 is a reasonable starting value that balances the need for learning with the limitations of the low-resource environment. The `weight_decay` will be set to a very low value (1e-06) to avoid any over-regularization while still promoting some weight sparsity. For `momentum`, I have chosen 0.9, which is standard and helps improve convergence. The `optimizer` will be set to AdamW, which performs well on smaller batches and fluctuating gradients. I’ll choose `local_epochs` as 2 to help the model consolidate training without overburdening the client. The `batch_size` will be 16 as this is conducive to low-resource training, and finally, I will assign a `dropout_rate` of 0.2 to help with overfitting, especially since this is the first round. For the server-side, considering that the server handles a deeper model with an additional three layers, I suggest a slightly higher `learning_rate` of 0.005, also using SGD optimizer for its better generalization on larger datasets compared to AdamW. A `momentum` of 0.9 matches the client to ensure smoother updates across federated training. The scheduler will be set to `StepLR`, which can help gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses, allowing for adjustments as needed. Finally, I suggest a `mu` of 0.01 for FedProx, as it’s a moderate starting point for regularizing the local model, providing a balance between local training and global model convergence.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 5
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 5] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 5 belongs to a low-resource cluster, the hyperparameters need to be configured to ensure stable training while maximizing potential performance. The chosen learning rate is set to 0.001, which is the same as the peer clients that performed well, helping to maintain consistency. The weight decay has been set to 1e-05 to reduce overfitting without imposing too much penalty given the resource constraints. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is a common choice that balances stability and oscillation during training. The optimizer is chosen to be 'AdamW' since it is adaptable and generally performs well across various tasks, especially in federated learning contexts. The learning rate scheduler is set to 'None' to simplify the learning process, considering this is the first round for the client. The batch size is set to 16, the smallest option, aiding stability in learning for weak clients. The local epochs are kept at 2, allowing sufficient updates while not overloading the capabilities of the client. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 is applied to prevent overfitting while keeping the model expressive enough. For the server-side, a learning rate of 0.005 and momentum of 0.9 with SGD optimizer is chosen since it is efficient for converging in deeper networks and works well with the selected learning rates. The scheduler is set to 'StepLR' to allow learning rate adjustments in further rounds. The mu value is fixed at 0.01, as this has shown to be effective in managing the FedProx regularization based on peer performance.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client's performance is suboptimal, especially as it operates in a low-resource environment. Therefore, it's essential to refine the hyperparameters by decreasing the learning rate and batch size to enable stable training. Additionally, introducing a learning rate scheduler may help in controlling the learning rate during training.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 8
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 8] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this Client ID is 8 from a medium-resource cluster and it's the client's first training round, the hyperparameters must balance efficiency and potential convergence without overloading the client. For the learning rate, 0.001 provides a stable starting point, particularly for ensemble models like ResNet, while higher rates could risk divergence. A weight decay of 0.0001 helps regularize the model without being too harsh, which is crucial given no prior history data. Momentum is set to 0.9 to accelerate convergence; for medium-resource clients, it's vital to maintain manageable training times without compromising learning dynamics. The optimizer is chosen as AdamW, which is generally more effective for image classification tasks, handling sparse gradients well. Using CosineAnnealingLR scheduler helps in adjusting the learning rate dynamically, which is beneficial for the model's convergence. Local epochs are set to 2 to allow for sufficient training without excessive load on the client, while a batch size of 32 balances memory usage and model gradient stability. A dropout rate of 0.2 prevents overfitting. On the server side, for those last two layers, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 with SGD optimizer is appropriate due to potentially larger gradients from deeper layers. The momentum is also maintained at 0.9 for consistency with client training processes, while a StepLR scheduler is suitable for this context, allowing simpler decay adjustments. Mu is set to 0.01, providing an adequate level of FedProx regularization to manage the potential discrepancies in the client models while maintaining a collaborative learning setup.

  Client 8, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 89.47%, Test Acc 48.55%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 30
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 30] ---
  - Reasoning: The choice of hyperparameters for the client in a split federated learning scenario is influenced by several factors including the client's resources, the previous peer's performance, and ensuring effective learning. Given that this client has moderate resources (Cluster 1), a balanced approach with respect to learning rate, batch size, and epochs is essential to avoid overwhelming the system. A learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as it provides a good trade-off between stability and convergence speed, particularly since it aligns with Client 8's successful parameters and is moderate enough for a first round. The weight decay of 0.0001 prevents overfitting while maintaining a reasonable level to help generalization. Momentum is set to 0.9 to enhance convergence momentum, which is typical for SGD-based optimizers. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen due to its adaptive learning properties, which suit the client's first training iteration well. The learning schedule uses 'CosineAnnealingLR' to adjust the learning rate dynamically, potentially improving model performance during training. For local training, 2 epochs are selected to enable better gradient updates without overwhelming this client, and a batch size of 32 is a good compromise between training speed and memory usage. A dropout rate of 0.2 is included to mitigate overfitting while still allowing significant training. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.005 is proposed, slightly higher than the client's, to reflect the deeper model's needs. The server also uses an SGD optimizer which is often effective in combination with a cosine annealing schedule for robust convergence. A momentum of 0.9 is consistent across both client and server to maintain training cohesion. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 serves as a stable regularization constant to balance between local and global interests in federated learning contexts.

  - Reasoning: For the client hyperparameters, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected to ensure stable convergence while being effective for initially training on CIFAR-10 with ResNet18. A weight decay of 0.0001 is appropriate to prevent overfitting without imposing a strong penalty which is crucial since the client has medium computational resources. The momentum is set to 0.9, balancing improvements in convergence speed and stability. Given that clients 8 and 30 both employed the AdamW optimizer, it is chosen for its adaptive learning capabilities, especially useful in resource-constrained environments. A cosine annealing learning rate scheduler is indicated to adjust the learning rate effectively during training, helping to improve the final model's performance while maintaining computational feasibility. The local epochs are set to 2 to allow enough training time without being too intensive. A batch size of 32 is selected, as it is a balanced choice betweenperformance and resource demands for medium-capacity clients. A dropout rate of 0.2 is included to enhance model generalization and reduce overfitting. For the server, a learning rate of 0.005 is adopted, acknowledging that a more complex server model might need adjustments in learning rate compared to the client. Momentum is kept at 0.9 for consistency with the client and improving convergence. SGD is chosen as it's effective for deeper networks and widely used in literature for federated learning, particularly in conjunction with ResNet architectures. The StepLR scheduler is implemented to provide consistent learning rate adjustments across training rounds, which can be beneficial given the nature of federated learning. For the mu parameter, a value of 0.01 is selected as a middle-ground to apply FedProx regularization adequately without overly constraining the updates of the local clients, balancing local and global considerations.

  Client 51, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 80.96%, Test Acc 52.63%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 15
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 15] ---
  - Reasoning: Given this client's medium-resource capacity, we've chosen hyperparameters that balance performance and computational load. The learning rate is set to 0.001, which has been successful for other clients like Client 30 who had an accuracy of 52.65%. Weight decay is set to 0.0001 to provide a minimal regularization effect, preventing overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. The momentum of 0.9 is consistent with best practices for SGD and was also used successfully by other peers. The optimizer is selected as AdamW, which tends to perform well on image datasets like CIFAR-10 due to its adaptive nature and capability to handle sparse gradients. The scheduler is set to CosineAnnealingLR to allow dynamic learning rate adjustments throughout training, which can enhance performance. Local epochs are kept at 2, leveraging the small scale of the dataset without overburdening the client. A batch size of 32 aligns with commonly used sizes in deep learning, striking a balance between convergence speed and resource utilization. The dropout rate of 0.2 also aligns with practices used in the other client's models, helping to prevent overfitting. For the server-side, I've chosen a learning rate of 0.005 to maintain a reasonable pace of updates given the server's deeper model configuration, along with SGD optimization which is simpler for the server's architecture. The momentum remains at 0.9 for consistency. The scheduler is the same as the client side to ensure smooth updates throughout the training process. Finally, mu is set at 0.01 based on the previous successful settings from the peer clients, providing effective FedProx regularization.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 50.97% suggests that the current hyperparameters may not be adequately optimized for the ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10. The learning rate might be too high, and there's potential to adjust the dropout rate to mitigate overfitting. Additionally, experimenting with different batch sizes and optimizers could help refine the model's performance.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 31
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 31] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the performance history of Client 31 and peer clients, a careful selection of hyperparameters is crucial to improve test accuracy. First, the learning rate should be set to 0.001, as it is within the provided search space and has shown good performance in peer tests. The weight decay is chosen to be 5e-05, balancing regularization while avoiding overfitting. For momentum, 0.9 is retained as it is standard and has yielded reasonable results thus far. Switching to the 'RMSprop' optimizer is preferred due to its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be beneficial given the fluctuating performance observed. The 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is kept, as it promotes better convergence with learning rate adjustments. Two local epochs are suitable given the medium-resource capacity of the client. I propose a smaller batch size of 16 to ease memory consumption on the client-side. A dropout rate of 0.25 is selected to help prevent overfitting, as observed from peers who maintained similar strategies. On the server-side, I recommend a learning rate of 0.001 for stable training of the deeper layers of the model, alongside 'SGD' as the optimizer due to its robust performance in deep learning tasks. A momentum of 0.9 is maintained. 'CosineAnnealingLR' remains as the learning rate scheduler for the server as well, promoting harmony with the client-side setup. Lastly, I suggest keeping the mu value at 0.01 for FedProx regularization since it has so far shown the desired effect on model training.

  - Reasoning: For the client-side hyperparameters, the learning rate of 0.004 is selected as it's aggressive enough to promote faster convergence while staying within the range. The weight decay is set to 0.0005 to provide a moderate regularization effect, preventing overfitting without greatly impacting training. The momentum remains at 0.9, a common choice for stabilizing the optimization process. AdamW is selected as it generally performs well with deep learning tasks like ResNet due to its adaptive nature. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' will adjust the learning rate dynamically, potentially improving convergence. The local_epochs is set to 2 to allow enough iterations for effective local training given this is a high-resource client. The batch size is chosen as 256, the largest in the available options, to fully utilize the resources and potentially speed up the training. A dropout rate of 0.2 is maintained to reduce overfitting while still allowing for sufficient model capacity.

For the server-side hyperparameters, a learning rate of 0.003 is selected as it is suitable for models that are generally more complex and typically benefit from a slightly lower learning rate compared to the client. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain consistency with the client’s optimizer. SGD is chosen for the server optimizer as it is often effective for global aggregation in federated learning scenarios. The StepLR scheduler is selected to impose periodic learning rate decay as it allows the server to refine its monitoring more effectively over epochs.

Finally, the mu parameter for FedProx regularization is set to 0.01, as this value balances model complexity with training stability, allowing for the regularization benefits without overly stifling the learning process.

  Client 86, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 78.76%, Test Acc 42.03%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 74
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 74] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the client's high-resource capabilities, a larger learning rate and batch size are appropriate to accelerate training. Since the previous configuration yielded only 17.52% accuracy, adjustments are necessary to explore potentially more effective parameters while considering recent peer performance. Given Client 86's success with a learning rate of 0.004, I opted for a slightly more aggressive rate of 0.006. The weight decay has been increased to prevent overfitting, aligning with typical practices observed in training deeper models. The optimizer remains as AdamW for its adaptive learning benefits. For the scheduler, I've retained CosineAnnealingLR for its effective decay properties. With two local epochs and a batch size of 256 being efficient for powerful clients, I've maintained these values. The dropout rate remains at 0.2 as it balances regularization and model capacity.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 22.88% suggests that the current hyperparameter configuration is suboptimal for the ResNet18 model on CIFAR10. The model may benefit from a more aggressive learning rate and larger batch sizes due to the high-resource capabilities of the client. Given the existing low performance, adjustments will focus on potentially increasing the learning rate and batch size, while also considering a small adjustment to the dropout rate to mitigate possible overfitting.

  - Reasoning: Considering the client's low-resource context, a smaller learning rate and batch size are crucial for stability during training. The previous learning rate was 0.001, which aligns with the requirement for low-resource clients, so I kept it the same. I reduced the weight decay to 1e-06, as a lighter regularization will help during training given the low capacity. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain a balance in convergence rates. For optimization, 'AdamW' was selected since it typically handles sparse updates better than 'SGD'. The scheduler is set to 'None' to avoid the complexities of learning rate schedules for a weak client. I chose 2 local epochs to allow some model improvement while keeping computational demands manageable. The batch size is set to 16, which is suitable for low-resource clients, allowing more frequent updates without overloading the system. The dropout rate is kept at 0.2 to help regularization without significant loss of information.

For the server side, I opted for a learning rate of 0.001, which is reasonable for the deeper layers of the model while ensuring stability given the federated learning context. I selected 'SGD' as the optimizer, as it is often effective for more established models like ResNet, and set the momentum to 0.9 for effective training dynamics. A scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to adjust the learning rate dynamically for optimal training performance. The value for mu is selected at 0.01, balancing the regularization effect against the local updates from clients, ensuring that they don’t diverge too much from the global model.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client is a low-resource client, and the final test accuracy indicates potential issues with stability and convergence. To improve performance, I will lower the learning rate and batch size to ensure that the model trains more stably on limited resources. Additionally, I will introduce weight decay to manage overfitting and suggest reducing the dropout rate slightly to retain more information in the model.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 87] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 87 is a low-resource client, we opted for parameters that enhance stability during training. Starting with a smaller learning rate of 0.0005 ensures that updates don't cause drastic changes, which is crucial for low-resource scenarios. The weight decay has been set to a low value of 1e-06 to avoid overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively. The momentum is set to 0.9, a commonly effective choice for accelerating gradient descent. The 'AdamW' optimizer is chosen for its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which is beneficial for low-resource clients. Local epochs are limited to 1 to maintain low resource utilization, while a batch size of 16 is used to ensure stable updates without overwhelming resources. A dropout rate of 0.2 is included to help mitigate overfitting while conditioning the model's robustness to noise. For the server, which operates on a deeper model, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen for effective convergence given the complexity of the model layers. The 'SGD' optimizer is selected as it often performs well on server-side models for more stable convergence in federated learning. The momentum is the same as on the client side (0.9) for consistency, with the ‘CosineAnnealingLR’ scheduler selected to help adaptively manage the learning rate during training rounds. The chosen mu value of 0.01 for FedProx regularization aims to balance the divergence of local updates from the global model and contributes to overall training stability.

  - Reasoning: Given that Client 85 belongs to a low-resource cluster, hyperparameters should prioritize stability and efficiency. The learning rate is set to a lower value of 0.0005, as seen in peer clients, which suggests this is effective for achieving initial convergence. The weight decay is set at 1e-06 to avoid excessive regularization, which can be detrimental for smaller dataset sizes like CIFAR-10. The momentum is set at 0.9 since it’s commonly effective in training deep networks. The chosen optimizer is AdamW, which is often more effective for smaller datasets as it can adaptively control the learning rates. The local epochs are limited to 1 to ensure reduced computation time per update while also maximizing the frequency of updates given the low-capacity client. A batch size of 16 is selected again for stability and lower memory requirements. The dropout rate is set to 0.2, which provides enough robustness without risking underfitting, particularly in the early rounds where the model may not generalize well. The server-side learning rate is selected at 0.001, which is consistent with the needs of deeper layers of the model that the server will train, as it allows a slightly faster learning than the client. The momentum is again set to 0.9, aligning with effective practices for complex models. The server optimizer 'SGD' is established as a standard choice when working with complex architectures requiring generalization. The scheduler is set to 'None' for simplicity as complex scheduling may be unnecessary for initial rounds. Finally, mu is chosen as 0.01, a common choice that helps balance the impact of local and global updates across federated rounds without over-penalizing clients with limited resources.

  - Reasoning: Given the client's recent history of improvements, we will make deliberate choices to enhance performance while remaining within the constraints of a medium-resource client. The learning rate is selected to be 0.0005, with a slight increase from the last epoch, balancing exploration and convergence, as the accuracy is showing a trending improvement but can benefit from optimization. The weight decay is set to 1e-05, as this has been effective for the client thus far, and helps prevent overfitting. We will maintain the momentum at 0.9 to provide stability in updates. The 'optimizer' will be chosen as 'Adam', given its adaptability and generally good performance on convolutional architectures. The 'scheduler' remains 'CosineAnnealingLR', ensuring a dynamic learning rate adjustment to foster performance improvements as the training progresses. We will keep the `local_epochs` at 2, in line with previous successful trials, and select a `batch_size` of 32, which is manageable for the medium resources available. Lastly, we will keep the `dropout_rate` at 0.25, as it appears to successfully mitigate overfitting without overly sacrificing capacity. 

For the server, we will use a learning rate of 0.001, which is near the lower end of the server expectations and ideal for stabilizing learning in deeper networks. The server will also use an SGD optimizer, as it tends to outperform Adam on mature training with stabilized learning rates, especially combined with momentum. A typical value of 0.9 will be retained for momentum, and we will adopt the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler for its benefits in managing learning dynamics in multiple phases. The choice of `mu` is set to 0.01, providing a subtle regularization that attends to any discrepancies between client and server updates while ensuring similar learning objectives.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 13
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 13] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the client's previous performance (Test Accuracy of 27.26% with the dropped HPs indicating a need for refinement) and the peer's better performance (58.40% Accuracy), adjustments are necessary to enhance client-side training. Given that peer client 31 has lower learning rates and different weight decay parameters leading to significantly better results, I recommend lowering the learning rate further to 0.0005 for the client while increasing weight decay for improved regularization to avoid overfitting. Setting `local_epochs` to 2 is advisable since it matches the previously successful configuration, while a `batch_size` of 32 balances client capabilities and data exposure effectively. Using AdamW remains beneficial due to its adaptive learning properties; however, switching the momentum value to the upper limit of 0.99 could promote faster convergence. A `dropout_rate` of 0.25 is sensible, preventing overfitting given the complexity of ResNet18 on CIFAR10. For the server-side, the use of a higher learning rate (0.002) will be beneficial for training deeper layers alongside a 'StepLR' scheduler for better learning adaptation at scale. The momentum is kept at 0.9 for consistency with the client's optimization strategy. The mu remains at 0.01, striking a balance in regularization while not heavily affecting local updates.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 99
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 99] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for Client 99, I considered the context of previous clients and the client's own capacity. Given the first round, a cautious approach with moderate values is optimal. The learning rate is set to 0.0005, which is consistent with previous clients and falls within the lower range to accommodate the client's medium resource constraints. The weight decay is set to 1e-05 to prevent overfitting without being overly aggressive. The momentum is set to 0.9 to enhance convergence speed, while the 'AdamW' optimizer is chosen for its efficiency in updating weights during training. A CosineAnnealingLR scheduler provides a systematic adjustment of the learning rate during training. Local epochs are set to 2, allowing sufficient training without overwhelming client resources, and a batch size of 32 is selected to balance between throughput and resource usage. The dropout rate is set at 0.25 to promote generalization. For the server, I chose a higher learning rate of 0.002 compared to the client, allowing for more aggressive updates since the server processes deeper layers of the model. Momentum remains at 0.9, and the optimizer is set to 'SGD' given the generality of this setting for server-side computations. The CosineAnnealingLR scheduler is also suitable for the server to control learning rate fluctuations effectively. Finally, mu is set at 0.01, a balanced choice to ensure effective FedProx regularization without overly constraining updates.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 45
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 45] ---
  - Reasoning: This configuration is tailored for a high-resource client using ResNet18 on CIFAR10 within a SplitFederated Learning environment. The first key decision was to select an appropriate learning rate. A higher learning rate of 0.005 is chosen to leverage the client's capabilities while balancing the need for stability in training. A weight decay of 0.0001 is implemented to encourage generalization and prevent overfitting, which is essential in federated settings. The momentum is set at 0.9 to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, improving convergence speed. The 'AdamW' optimizer is selected for its advantages in handling sparse gradients and its adaptive learning rate characteristics, which are particularly beneficial when dealing with diverse data distributions typical in federated learning. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is utilized to adjust the learning rate periodically, promoting better convergence. For local epochs, 2 are chosen to ensure sufficient training without excessive resource consumption. A batch size of 64 strikes a balance between computational efficiency and effective gradient estimation, considering the high resources available. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is included to regularize the model and prevent overfitting to the local data. 

On the server side, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen, which is lower than the client’s to ensure stable updates that aggregate gradients from multiple clients. The optimizer remains 'SGD' since it is generally better suited for a server handling aggregated gradient updates. Momentum is again set to 0.9 to maintain consistency across both client and server. The 'StepLR' scheduler allows for systematic learning rate adjustments at defined intervals, which can help in stabilizing training over time. 

Lastly, 'mu' is set at 0.01, representing a moderate level of FedProx regularization that accommodates the potential benefits of addressing discrepancies in local model updates while allowing sufficient flexibility in learning.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 26
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 26] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high resource capabilities of Client 26, I opted for higher values for batch size and learning rate. A learning rate of 0.005 is aggressive but suitable for powerful clients like Client 26, promoting faster convergence. The weight decay is set to 0.0001, which helps regularize the model without being too restrictive, while a momentum of 0.9 balances the gradient updates effectively since it aids in navigating challenging terrains of the loss landscape. The AdamW optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning capabilities, especially suitable for training deep networks such as ResNet18. The usage of CosineAnnealingLR as a scheduler allows for a smooth decay of the learning rate, which can help in fine-tuning the model in later training phases. Local epochs are set to 2, allowing the client to update adequately given this is its first round of participation. The batch size of 64 balances memory efficiency while still providing enough samples for reliable gradient estimation. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 provides a good regularization effect without adding excessive noise to the training process.

For the server settings, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected, considering that the server is tasked with training the remaining layers which may require a more conservative approach. The momentum is also set to 0.9, ensuring consistent updates. Choosing 'SGD' as the optimizer maintains stability during training, which is crucial for server-side computations. The StepLR scheduler is used to maintain a controlled learning rate decay, crucial for broader epochs due to possible variance in client updates. Finally, mu is set to 0.01 to provide moderate regularization on the client updates under the FedProx scheme, ensuring good performance and cooperation among clients.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 71
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 71] ---
  - Reasoning: The choice of hyperparameters for the client and server takes into consideration the client’s high-resource capacity, the performance of similar clients, and the previous training performance. For the client-side, I increased the `batch_size` to the maximum of 256 to leverage the client's powerful resources. The `learning_rate` was kept the same at 0.005, since it provided a decent balance for maintaining stability, and we don’t want to compromise the learning process given the results of the previous epoch. The `weight_decay` is kept at 0.0001 to regularize the model without introducing too much bias. The `momentum` is maintained at 0.9, aligning with successful strategies; however, we are leaning towards optimizing other factors before tweaking momentum further. `Optimizer` remains as `AdamW` for adaptive learning, and we continue using the `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler due to its effective adjustments through the training process. `Local_epochs` remains at 2, as reducing it while maintaining performance may not be beneficial. The `dropout_rate` is maintained at 0.2 to prevent overfitting while still allowing significant feature learning. In terms of server-side hyperparameters, `learning_rate` is set at 0.001 for stability on the server given its additional complexity, `momentum` remains at 0.9, the `optimizer` is set to `SGD` as it's standard for more complex server models, and `scheduler` is chosen as `StepLR` to adapt the server model's learning rate more effectively over time based on performance. The `mu` parameter is kept at 0.01, offering a moderate level of FedProx regularization, which has been shown to help model convergence in federated environments.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 52
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 52] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for Client 52, I considered its high-resource capacity, the actions taken by peer clients 45 and 71, and overall performance trends. Given the context of the first training round and Client 52's ability to handle larger batch sizes, I've tuned several hyperparameters accordingly.

1. **Learning Rate**: I selected a learning rate of **0.005**, which is mid-range and has been successful for similar clients (see Client 71). It balances the need for faster convergence without overshooting.

2. **Weight Decay**: A weight decay of **0.0001** helps to prevent overfitting while allowing some flexibility in training performance, as used by successful peers.

3. **Momentum**: A momentum of **0.9** has been effective for other clients, helping in accelerating gradients vectors in the right directions, thus it is chosen here.

4. **Optimizer**: I chose **'AdamW'** for its capability of managing higher learning rates and improving convergence faster compared to SGD in the context of high-resource clients.

5. **Scheduler**: The **'CosineAnnealingLR'** scheduler is preferred, as it can help adjust the learning rate more dynamically, improving training potentially over epochs.

6. **Local Epochs**: **2** local epochs are set to provide sufficient training on the client's data without overloading in the first round, allowing the model to learn well.

7. **Batch Size**: A batch size of **256** takes advantage of the client's high capacity and has shown to yield better convergence results in peer clients.

8. **Dropout Rate**: I set the dropout rate to **0.2** to maintain some regularization without excessively hindering learning capacity.

For the server parameters:
- The learning rate of **0.001** is conservative but effective for the server-side model, reflecting performance from peers like Client 45.
- Momentum remains at **0.9**, maintaining consistency with the client's settings for stability.
- I chose **'SGD'** for the optimizer here, favoring stability and reliability for deeper model layers.
- The scheduler will be **'StepLR'** to provide a structured and gradual learning rate reduction.

For the global hyperparameter mu, I set it at **0.01** which was common among peers and effective in preventing drift while fostering collaborative learning.

  - LLM Reasoning: The current hyperparameter settings are leading to suboptimal performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Given that the client has a high resource capacity, we can afford to increase the batch size for better gradient estimation and potentially increase the learning rate to speed up convergence. Additionally, we should explore switching the optimizer to SGD with a learning rate decay strategy to stabilize training.

  - Reasoning: Given the client's low-resource capacity, a smaller learning rate of 0.00025 is selected to stabilize training, as higher learning rates often lead to instability in such clients. The weight decay is set to 1e-06, which is a minimal value to prevent overfitting while still keeping the model flexible. A momentum value of 0.8 is chosen, which is on the lower end but suitable for low-resource clients, helping with convergence without overly influencing weight updates. The AdamW optimizer is retained from the previous epoch since it generally performs well in low-resource settings due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities. The scheduler is kept as 'None' to avoid unnecessary complexity at this stage. Due to the client's constraints, I opted for local_epochs of 1 and a batch_size of 16, as both are consistent with the client's need for stability and fit within their capability. A dropout rate of 0.1 is reasonable to, providing a slight regularization effect without losing too much of the model’s capacity. For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is appropriate given that it needs to manage a deeper model, and the momentum is set to 0.9 for stability. The SGD optimizer is better suited for server-side training with the current architecture being deeper. Lastly, a scheduler is not used, keeping it straightforward for current adjustments. A mu of 0.01 is consistent with past settings, aiming to balance between optimization and convergence in the federated context.

  - Reasoning: Given the context of Client ID 48 being a low-resource client and the overall training dynamics of Split Federated Learning, the hyperparameters were chosen with an emphasis on stability and ensuring effective learning in a resource-constrained environment. The learning rate of 0.00025 is derived from observing peer Client 85, who performed reasonably well; this is low enough to ensure stability for the first training round. A weight decay of 1e-06 is selected, which is minimal yet effective to prevent overfitting on limited resources. The momentum is set to 0.8, representing a conservative choice for smoother gradient updates. The optimizer used is AdamW, a more adaptive optimizer which tends to perform better in unstable training environments. A batch size of 16 is chosen, as smaller batches can help compensate for the low computational capacity. Local epochs are limited to 1 to minimize resource usage while still allowing enough training. A dropout rate of 0.2 is introduced to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting during this initial training phase.

  - Reasoning: Considering the client's low-resource capacity and the performance history of both the client and peers, I suggest a cautious approach to hyperparameter selection. The previous 'learning_rate' of 0.001 was on the higher side given the client's constraints and resulted in low accuracy (39.97%). Therefore, I opt for a slightly lower learning rate of 0.00025, which aligns with peer 85 and 48's successful performance while still within the defined range. For 'weight_decay', selecting a value of 1e-06 is reasonable, as seen in peer setups and allows a bit of regularization without overwhelming the model's learning capacity. Since both peer clients used the 'AdamW' optimizer, I choose the same for smoother updates given the splitting burdens. The 'batch_size' is kept to 16, accommodating low-resource capabilities. The 'local_epochs' remain at 1 to reduce computation per round. A dropout rate of 0.2 is maintained as it was deemed effective in previous trials. On the server-side, I recommend a learning rate of 0.001 aligned with peer usage that balances effective training stability and accuracy given the server workload. The optimizer remains 'SGD' and the momentum is set at 0.9 to enhance convergence speed. I will retain the 'scheduler' as 'None' to keep the configuration straightforward and stable this epoch. The 'mu' is kept at 0.01 to maintain consistency with previous rounds while still allowing FedProx regularization to balance local and global updates effectively.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 78
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 78] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the limitations of Client 78's low-resource environment, a conservative approach is adopted. The learning rate is set to 0.00025, matching peer clients that had promising results and remaining on the lower side of the hyperparameter range for stability. Weight decay is adjusted to 1e-06 to prevent overfitting while keeping it minimal, akin to peers' values. A momentum of 0.8, consistent with peer choices, was selected to enhance convergence. AdamW is chosen as the optimizer for better performance in adapting learning rates, especially in limited-resource settings. A batch size of 16 is selected to prevent memory overloads and accommodate local training capabilities. Using a dropout rate of 0.1 helps in regularizing the model slightly without being too aggressive. The local epochs are set to 1, emphasizing the need for rapid updates without overwhelming the client. For the server, the learning rate is slightly higher at 0.001 with maintained momentum of 0.9 and SGD optimizer to ensure stability with server-side computations. The scheduler is set to 'None' as simple settings may help avoid unnecessary complication. The mu parameter is maintained at 0.01, derived from peer performance analysis.

  - LLM Reasoning: The client's test accuracy is relatively low, indicating that the hyperparameters might not be optimal for the low-resource scenario. To enhance stability and performance, I will reduce the learning rate and consider lowering the batch size while applying a greater weight decay. These adjustments should help improve convergence.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 72
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 72] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 72 operates in a low-resource environment, it is imperative to select hyperparameters that support stable training without overwhelming the system. Starting with the learning rate, the candidates from the peer clients point towards generally lower settings being more successful. Thus, I selected 0.00025, which balances effective learning with controlled adjustments.

For weight decay, I selected 1e-06, which keeps regularization light and is consistent with peers' settings without making it overly complex for the model to learn. Momentum is left at 0.8, allowing for enough inertia without leading to divergence or instability, particularly with smaller learning rates.

The optimizer remains as 'AdamW', given its adaptiveness which is particularly beneficial for lower-resource setups like the ones in Cluster 0. On the other hand, I opted for 'None' for the scheduler because smaller batches over fewer epochs (local epochs of 1) should stabilize the learning process, allowing lower adjustments in learning rate without the added complexity of a scheduling mechanism.

For the local epochs, a setting of 1 is chosen in line with maintaining efficiency, especially in a low-resource context. Given the historical success of batch size 16 across peers, it ensures efficient memory use without sacrificing too much throughput. Lastly, the dropout rate is set at 0.1, reflecting common practices that keep model capacity well-regulated while allowing for enough expressivity.

On the server-side, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as it offers a moderate pace for the deeper architecture without leading to unstable training dynamics given the more complex nature of the model handling the last three layers. I kept momentum at 0.9 to ensure sufficient momentum through gradients. The optimizer remains as 'SGD' which is stable for the type of model used, and 'None' for the scheduler as the learning situation does not demand aggressive adjustments.

Finally, the value of mu is set at 0.01, aligning with practices that provide a suitable balance between proximal regularization and individual client contribution, ensuring that local updates do not deviate too far from global expectations.

  - Reasoning: Given that this is Client 22's first round and they belong to Cluster 1 (Medium-Resource), it is vital to choose hyperparameters that balance performance and resource constraints. For the client configuration, a learning rate of 0.001 is selected to allow for gradual convergence without overshooting since this is a new client. The weight decay is set to a moderate value of 1e-04, which encourages generalization without being overly restrictive. Momentum is set to 0.9 to improve the optimizer's performance by providing inertia. AdamW is chosen as the optimizer due to its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be beneficial for clients with moderate resources. CosineAnnealingLR is chosen as the scheduler to help with learning rate adjustment over epochs. The client will run for 2 local_epochs to leverage its medium capacity efficiently while a batch_size of 32 strikes a balance between memory usage and learning efficiency. A dropout rate of 0.2 is selected to mitigate overfitting during training.

For the server configuration, a learning rate of 0.005 is selected, which is appropriate for a deeper model that can handle a slightly larger learning rate. Additionally, the momentum is also set to 0.9, aligning with the client's selected momentum to help ensure consistency in training dynamics. SGD is chosen as the optimizer for the server due to its capacity to handle the aggregated updates more effectively in a federated setup. Lastly, the StepLR scheduler is chosen to control the learning rate during training at the server side effectively.

The mu parameter is set to 0.01 to introduce a reasonable level of regularization through FedProx, balancing the local objective with global model objectives, especially crucial in a federated learning setting with potential data heterogeneity.

  - Reasoning: The selected hyperparameters are chosen based on the client and server's resource capacities, previous peer performance, and the inferred need for balance between exploration and convergence in this split federated learning context. 

1. **Client Learning Rate (0.001)**: This is a standard starting point for many applications, providing a balance to avoid drastic updates while allowing the model to learn effectively, especially considering this client's moderate resources.
2. **Weight Decay (0.0005)**: A small weight decay term will help to regularize the model without overwhelming it, especially with the FedProx regularization applied by 'mu'. 
3. **Momentum (0.9)**: This value is fairly standard and should help the optimizer maintain a good convergence velocity without oscillation. 
4. **Optimizer ('AdamW')**: AdamW is chosen due to its adaptive learning capability, which is particularly beneficial for clients with moderate resources. It also works well with deeper networks like ResNet. 
5. **Scheduler ('CosineAnnealingLR')**: This scheduling strategy helps in gradually reducing the learning rate, adapting as the training progresses, thus allowing further tuning towards convergence in later epochs without sudden drops in learning rate.
6. **Local Epochs (2)**: This allows the client to learn sufficiently from its local data while balancing the need for periodic synchronization with the server.
7. **Batch Size (32)**: This is a reasonable batch size that fits the medium-resource classification, enabling effective training while being manageable within memory constraints.
8. **Dropout Rate (0.2)**: A small dropout rate is chosen to prevent overfitting given that the client is just beginning its first round.
9. **Server Learning Rate (0.005)**: A slightly higher learning rate is appropriate for the server, allowing it to manage its complex layers effectively while processing aggregated updates from clients.
10. **Server Momentum (0.9)**: This momentum value will aid in rapid convergence, given the server has access to more computational resources.
11. **Server Optimizer ('SGD')**: SGD is selected for its effectiveness in large models such as those running on the server, particularly with a well-tuned learning rate.
12. **Server Scheduler ('StepLR')**: This allows for a systematic decrease in learning rate after certain epochs, suitable for a more complex model on the server. 
13. **Mu (0.01)**: A moderate value for mu is chosen, as the first round of training may benefit from some regularization to ensure that the local model does not stray too far from the global model. This helps maintain a balance between local updates and overall model performance across clients.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 51] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the client's current setup and the performance of peers, adjustments are needed to improve accuracy. Reducing the learning rate slightly could help find a better minimum. A small weight decay can improve generalization while remaining low enough not to overwhelm local training. The original learning rate of 0.001 will remain but be adjusted to 0.0005 to ensure more stable learning. Keeping weight decay at a lower level (5e-05) is advisable due to the moderate client capacity. The momentum can remain high at 0.9 for quicker convergence. Leveraging AdamW as the optimizer provides advantages in weight updating with regularization, while maintaining the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler can help manage the learning rate effectively over the epochs. I recommend maintaining local_epochs at 2 for sufficient training time and a batch_size of 32, which balances memory usage and convergence speed. The dropout rate can stay at 0.2 to prevent overfitting without disproportional loss of information.

On the server side, since it handles deeper layers which are more complex and can often lead to overfitting, I would suggest a slightly lower learning rate of 0.004, allowing nuanced updates while training a more complicated model. The momentum can remain at 0.9. 'SGD' is recommended as the optimizer for stability and consistency, and the 'StepLR' scheduler can help adjust the learning rate properly as training progresses, providing more predictable adjustments. Finally, there is a good foundation with mu set at 0.01, which promotes some regularization for the clients' gradients, helping to control the overall model complexity while training. Overall, these adjustments are designed to improve accuracy without overwhelming the moderate resources of the client.

  - Reasoning: Considering the client operates in a high-resource environment, we can afford to choose larger batch sizes and possibly increase the learning rate to accelerate convergence on the training data. Given the client history, a learning rate of 0.004 produced better results in terms of accuracy, so I'm opting for a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 to boost training speed while still maintaining stability. Utilizing AdamW as the optimizer will allow for better handling of the large batch sizes and offers adaptive learning rates per parameter. A batch size of 512 is chosen to leverage client resources without overwhelming the local optimization process. The local epochs remain at 2, as this was effective in earlier training rounds. The weight decay is kept low to prevent harmful regularization effects, while the momentum is set to 0.9 to maintain a good balance between acceleration and stability during the optimization process. The dropout rate is kept at 0.2 to help manage overfitting without overly constraining the model.

  - Reasoning: To improve the performance of the high-resource client while considering peer performance, I've selected hyperparameters that emphasize training efficiency, stability, and adaptability. A learning rate of 0.008 is chosen as it is slightly more aggressive than the previous setting, which might help in achieving better convergence rates. A weight decay of 0.0001 maintains some regularization without overly penalizing model complexity. Momentum is set to 0.9, aligning with previous successful configurations and maintaining stability during training. The optimizer remains AdamW, which is favorable for its performance on ResNet architectures. The scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for dynamic learning rate adaptation, increasing flexibility. Local epochs are set to 2 for sufficient training without overfitting. The batch size is increased to 256 to utilize the high-resource capability of the client fully. The dropout rate is set to 0.3, balancing regularization and potential overfitting. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.004 is selected, lower than the client's to adapt the model training dynamics effectively. The server also uses SGD optimizer for simplicity while employing the 'StepLR' scheduler to fine-tune server-side learning patterns. Finally, mu remains set at 0.01, aiming to balance client-server contribution effectively through federated learning context.

  - Reasoning: The choices for the client-side hyperparameters are driven by the low-resource capacity of the client, which necessitates more stable training parameters. Lower learning rates will help in stabilizing the training process, and smaller batch sizes are also suitable for low-capacity clients. Given the previous training history, I'm selecting a learning rate of 0.0005 to aid convergence without overshooting, and I will set the batch_size to 16 for stability. A local_epochs setting of 2 allows for more iterations on the small dataset, and keeping a moderate weight_decay (1e-05) can mitigate overfitting. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as it helps perform better on small data. The dropout rate is chosen to be 0.1 to introduce some regularization. As for the server-side parameters, since the model complexity increases and the server will manage more layers, a learning_rate of 0.001 is chosen as a balance between convergence speed and stability, using 'SGD' for its effectiveness in deep networks. I'll choose 'StepLR' as the scheduling method to control the learning rate over epochs effectively, maintaining a momentum of 0.9 for good stochastic approximation. The mu value remains at 0.01 to provide a small regularization term to enhance model generalization.

  - Reasoning: The choice of hyperparameters for the client and server takes into account the previous epoch performances, the available search space, and the need for improvement based on the achieved accuracy. The client's learning rate is set to 0.0003 to provide a small but effective step toward convergence after observing the improvements from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2. A slightly lower weight decay of 1e-04 is chosen to balance regularization as the last value may have been too restrictive leading to a lower accuracy. The optimizer is set to 'Adam' as it generally provides better adaptive learning rates in lower resource situations; and the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is preferred for potential learning rate adjustments over time. A batch size of 16 is selected, consistent with the previous epoch to avoid overwhelming the client's moderate resources. The dropout rate is maintained at 0.25, close to the previous values while retaining robustness against overfitting. On the server side, to match a more complex model configuration, the learning rate is set at 0.001 which is slightly conservative, along with 'SGD' as it can generally handle larger batch updates more effectively, especially considering the deeper layers. For the scheduler, 'StepLR' is chosen to facilitate controlled learning rate decreases. Lastly, the regularization parameter 'mu' is set at 0.02 to balance the contributions from the client and server updates, which has been effective in previous contexts.

  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for the client and server, several factors were considered based on the context and previous performances. For the client, we will initially adjust the learning rate and weight decay based on peer 17’s successful experience with a lower learning rate and weight decay. Given that the client's learning rate from the last epoch resulted in a test accuracy of 41.80%, we will set it slightly lower than their previous attempt but within the successful range indicated by peer 17. We will also slightly decrease the weight decay for better generalization.

The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it's shown to work well in both previous attempts. The optimizer will be kept as 'AdamW' for the client, which is known to perform well with the kind of moderate resources available here. The local epochs will remain at 2 for sufficient training, and the batch size will be set to 32 to balance the resource constraints without overwhelming the client. For dropout rate, setting it to 0.25 will help mitigate overfitting while keeping it reasonable based on peer history.

On the server side, the server's learning rate will be slightly higher than the client's, which is common practice since the server aggregates and combines information. A learning rate of 0.005 is a good midpoint and consistent with typical choices for the server. We will keep the momentum at 0.9 and choose 'SGD' as the optimizer, given that it's a standard choice for stability in performance during server aggregation tasks. We'll use 'StepLR' for the scheduler to allow for effective learning rate adjustments during training.

Lastly, the mu parameter will be set at 0.01 to provide a small regularization effect, which has shown effectiveness in collaborative learning environments without being overly constraining.

The learning rate is currently set at 0.0004, which may be too high for effective convergence, and the SGD server optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005 may not be providing the needed stability. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.25 may not be sufficient to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I will reduce the client learning rate, adjust the server learning rate, and increase the dropout rate.

  - Reasoning: Given the client's moderate capacity, we need to select hyperparameters that optimize performance without overwhelming the client resources. The previous clients provided valuable insights into effective hyperparameters. Client 17 had a good performance (53.35%) with a lower learning rate (0.0003) and a smaller batch size (16), while Client 29 achieved a better accuracy (58.79%) with a slightly higher learning rate (0.0004) and a larger batch size (32). Thus, for Client 49, I recommend a middle-ground learning rate of 0.00035, which is expected to balance exploration and stability, while the batch size would be set to 32 to utilize moderate resources effectively. A weight decay of 0.0001 is reasonable to avoid overfitting, complementing the use of AdamW optimizer which is effective for learning rate scheduling. The momentum is set to 0.9 since it’s a common practice with modern optimizers for improving convergence speed. The client will run for 2 local epochs to enhance learning efficiency without excessive computational burden. For dropout rate, I opted for 0.25 based on previous successful configurations. On the server-side, I suggest utilizing 'SGD' with a learning rate of 0.001, which is a standard choice for server-side optimization, to encourage robust convergence. A momentum of 0.9 ensures that we retain the benefits of adaptive learning rates. Setting 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler will also help to adjust the learning rate progressively. Lastly, for mu, a value of 0.01 offers a moderate regularization that should effectively balance the local optimal from the client with the global objective on the server.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 27
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 27] ---
  - Reasoning: Considering the client's medium-resource capacity and the history of peer clients, I chose hyperparameters that balance effectiveness and resource usage. The learning rates were adjusted based on previous successes to retain competitiveness while not overwhelming the client’s resources. The weight decay is set higher to reduce overfitting for small datasets like CIFAR-10. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen because it adapts learning rates and generally performs well with ResNet architectures. The batch size is kept at 32 as it balances the need for faster updates with the limited resource capacities. Local epochs are set to 2, consistent with peers since it provides a good amount of training without excessive strain. The dropout rate is set to 0.25 to enhance generalization without being too severe. For server-side parameters, a learning rate of 0.001 is conservative yet effective for a deeper model, with 'SGD’ indicating a more stable convergence path. The server parameters align with those utilized by other clients to ensure synchronicity in learning. The mu value is increased to 0.02 to add a consistent level of regularization while aligning with the trends from peer successes.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 65.71% indicates there might be room for improvement in the hyperparameter settings. The current learning rate for the client's optimizer is relatively low for the AdamW optimizer, which may be limiting the model's learning capability. Adjusting the learning rates, increasing the dropout rate to prevent overfitting, and exploring different optimizers for the client could lead to better results. I will broaden the learning rate range for the client and increase the dropout rate to enhance regularization.

  - Reasoning: Given that the client is in Cluster 2 (High-Resource), it can leverage higher values for batch size, learning rate, and local epochs to accelerate training while maintaining performance. For the client, I recommend a learning rate of 0.005, which is a balanced choice that facilitates quicker convergence without overwhelming the model. The weight decay is set to a moderate value of 0.0001 to help prevent overfitting without significantly hindering the model's capacity to learn. A momentum value of 0.9 is chosen to stabilize updates during training. The optimizer 'AdamW' is preferred for this scenario as it typically performs better in terms of convergence speed and model performance on image classification tasks like CIFAR-10. The scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR', which helps smooth out the learning rate over epochs, allowing for a more granular exploration of the loss landscape. Given this is the first round for the client, it's advisable to use the maximum local epochs (2) to extract as much learning as possible from the client's data, and a higher batch size of 128 is chosen to expedite the training process while the model's performance is monitored. A dropout rate of 0.3 is selected as a reasonable compromise to ensure generalization, balancing between learning capacity and overfitting. For the server, which is focused on the deeper layers of ResNet18, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen, which is slightly lower to allow for more stable updates considering potentially higher gradients coming from the less-invasive lower architecture. The momentum is set similarly to the client at 0.9 to maintain cohesion in training dynamics. The 'SGD' optimizer is recommended for the server as it can provide stable convergence with clear gradients in deeper layers. A 'StepLR' scheduler is utilized to adjust the learning rate in a defined manner during the training iterations. Finally, a `mu` value of 0.01 is selected for the FedProx regularization, providing a good level of regularization to ensure convergence is balanced between local and global updates without being overly restrictive.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 10
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 10] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for this high-resource client using Split Federated Learning with a ResNet18 on CIFAR10, several considerations were taken into account. First, the client has sufficient computational capacity, which allows for larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates. Based on the peer's performance, which indicated good results using AdamW as the optimizer, that choice will be maintained. The suggested learning rate of 0.005 is slightly more aggressive than the peer's 0.005 and is within the recommended range, providing room for improvements. Selecting a batch size of 128 will leverage the client's high-resource capabilities and align with the best practices for optimizing mini-batch gradients without overwhelming capacity. A local epoch count of 2 is also chosen as it is sufficient for convergence while avoiding overfitting. The weight decay of 0.0001 balances regularization adequately. The dropout rate of 0.3 is consistent with practices for preventing overfitting in deep networks. On the server side, to ensure effective learning from the final layer, a moderate learning rate of 0.001 is selected, and SGD is chosen for its advantages in convergence in this federated context, complemented by a scheduler of StepLR. The mu value of 0.01 provides a balance in regularization for federated learning dynamics, supporting smooth convergence based on the previous client examples.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 46.14% indicates the model may benefit from adjustments to hyperparameters, particularly batch size and learning rate for the client, as well as exploring alternative optimizers. Increasing the batch size could help stabilize the learning process, while raising the learning rate allows for brisker convergence. Furthermore, testing with a different optimizer might enhance performance. As the client has high resources, these changes are feasible.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 19
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 19] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is Client 19's first round, it's critical to choose hyperparameters that balance performance and stability. Since this client belongs to Cluster 2 (high-resource), it can utilize larger batch sizes and learning rates effectively without risk of running out of memory. The previous clients (69 and 10) have shown that a learning rate of 0.005 combined with AdamW has been beneficial, indicating that this value may be a good starting point for Client 19. The weight decay parameter is set to a low value of 0.0001 to prevent overfitting, especially with a more complex model like ResNet18. The momentum is set to 0.9, balancing convergence speed and stability. For the optimizer, AdamW is selected given its robustness and adaptability. A batch size of 128 helps leverage the client’s resources effectively, while two local epochs strike a balance between local accuracy improvement and efficient resource usage. A dropout rate of 0.3 promotes regularization, which is crucial for preventing overfitting given the model complexity. On the server side, a learning rate of 0.001 is appropriate for the SGD optimizer typically used for deeper models, allowing for stable convergence. The server also shares the same momentum for consistency in optimization strategy. Lastly, a reasonably low mu of 0.01 is chosen to balance the regularization effect of FedProx against the model updates.

To refine the hyperparameter search, I will increase the client learning rate for a more aggressive training approach while also adjusting the batch size in accordance with the client's high resource capacity. Additionally, I will reduce the dropout rate to allow the network to learn more effectively. These changes should help enhance performance.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 88
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 88] ---
  - Reasoning: To optimize the performance of Client 88 on the CIFAR-10 dataset with ResNet18 under the SplitFed scheme, several factors were considered:

1. **Client Capacity & Batch Size:** Given that Client 88 operates in a high-resource cluster, a larger batch size of **128** is optimal as it balances computation efficiency and gradient estimation.

2. **Learning Rate & Regularization:** A learning rate of **0.005** is chosen based on the successful configurations of Client 69, as it is neither too aggressive nor too conservative for this strong client. The weight decay is set to **0.0001** to introduce moderate regularization, preventing overfitting while allowing the model to learn. This decision aligns well with the previous client performance that also used these settings.

3. **Optimizer & Momentum:** The AdamW optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning capabilities, particularly useful in the early stages of training, while a momentum of **0.9** is commonly applied to improve convergence speed without leading to excessive oscillations.

4. **Scheduler:** The **CosineAnnealingLR** scheduler is chosen to adjust the learning rate dynamically, allowing the model to converge more effectively by reducing the learning rate as training progresses.

5. **Local Epochs:** With Client 88 being high-capacity and the task being new, a maximum of **2** local epochs will help in better utilization of data before sending updates.

6. **Dropout Rate:** A dropout rate of **0.3** is adopted, providing a good balance between regularization and learning capacity for this type of architecture, considering it's the first round for this client.

7. **Server-Side Parameters:** For the server, a learning rate of **0.001** is standard and effective across federated learning scenarios. Given the potentially more complex deep learning task on the server side, SGD is selected due to its effectiveness in handling larger batch sizes with a momentum of **0.9**. The **StepLR** scheduler gracefully reduces the learning rate at defined intervals, aiding in optimal convergence as the server processes its data post-client updates.

8. **Mu Setting:** A moderate value of **0.01** is proposed for the FedProx regularization term (mu), balancing between global and local model contributions, reinforcing the model with local client updates without overriding their individual objectives unnecessarily.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 20
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 20] ---
  - Reasoning: For the client with ID 20 in Cluster 0 (a low-resource environment), I recommend smaller values for batch size and learning rate to ensure stable training as this is the first round for the client. A learning rate of 0.001 provides a good balance between convergence speed and stability. A batch size of 16 is appropriate for low-resource clients to avoid memory issues. Since this client may benefit from momentum, setting it to 0.9 is a balanced choice. The AdamW optimizer is recommended for its adaptive learning capabilities, which is particularly beneficial in cases with limited training resources. I suggest 2 local epochs to allow sufficient training while keeping resource usage in check. A dropout rate of 0.2 can help regularize the model, preventing overfitting on the limited local dataset. For the server, given that it runs a complex model with additional layers, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 is chosen, alongside the SGD optimizer, which can be more effective for optimizing deeper architectures in a federated learning setup. I recommend a momentum of 0.9 to maintain training stability and a CosineAnnealingLR scheduler to help manage learning rate adjustments over epochs. The mu (regularization term) is set to 0.01 to provide a balance between local and global model training.

  - LLM Reasoning: The weak performance indicated by a final test accuracy of 62.81% suggests that adjustments are needed for a low-resource client. We will reduce the learning rate and batch size for the client to increase training stability and provide a finer scale for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we will explore different optimizers and introduce a learning rate scheduler to enhance training.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 73
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 73] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first round for client 73 and it is classified as a low-resource client, the hyperparameters were selected to ensure stable training. A lower learning rate of 0.001 was chosen, as it is more suited for training with less capacity; this helps prevent large updates that could destabilize learning. The batch size of 16 was selected because small batches are generally more effective for low-capacity systems, allowing the client to converge without exhausting resources. Local epochs were kept to 2 to minimize overfitting and ensure fast updates. The optimizer 'AdamW' was selected for its performance in low-resource settings, and a weight decay of 1e-05 was included to prevent overfitting with a small amount of regularization. The dropout rate was set to 0.2 to encourage regularity during training. On the server side, considering the deeper architecture serving the last three layers of ResNet18, a slightly higher learning rate of 0.005 is more appropriate to facilitate learning from aggregated client updates. Using SGD was chosen for its simpler gradient update rules, which might be beneficial in the server's more complex scenario, along with a momentum of 0.9 for better convergence rates. The 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is suitable as it can help improve long-term training performance. Lastly, mu was set to 0.01 to add a small regularization effect without heavily restricting the client's updates, as it aims to balance the local objectives with the global model.

  - LLM Reasoning: Given that this client operates with low resources and their final test accuracy is only 60.07%, it's necessary to adjust the hyperparameters for more stable training. Lowering the learning rate will help prevent instability, and reducing the batch size could lead to better convergence for this low-resource client. Additionally, considering this client might benefit from a scheduled learning rate could enhance their ability to adapt during training.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 48
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 48] ---
  - Reasoning: For the client-side hyperparameters, given that this is a low-resource client with a history of using lower learning rates and smaller batch sizes, I recommend retaining a low learning rate of 0.00025, despite the minimum available in the search space. Increasing the local epochs to 2 can help with more stable training and better learning, and maintaining a batch size of 16 will further manage resources effectively. The weight decay can be increased slightly to 1e-05 to help with overfitting. The momentum is set to 0.9 because it has performed well in peer histories, and I suggest continuing with 'AdamW' as the optimizer for its adaptive learning properties. The dropout rate remains at 0.2 for regularization without excessive complexity. 

On the server-side, since it handles a more complex model (the remaining layers of ResNet18), I recommend a higher learning rate of 0.005 based on the performance improvements seen in peer clients. Keeping momentum at 0.9 is a good compromise for stability. The SGD optimizer is appropriate for its effectiveness in converging deeper networks, and I suggest using 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler to adaptively adjust the learning rate as training progresses, potentially improving final model performance. Finally, I maintain 'mu' at 0.01 for FedProx regularization as it aligns with client and peer settings while enhancing stability.

  - Reasoning: Given the client's moderate resource capacity and their previous experience achieving 50.71% test accuracy, careful consideration is necessary in choosing hyperparameters. I will maintain a balanced approach to stability and performance improvement. The learning rate is slightly increased to 0.0006 from the previous 0.0005 to potentially enhance convergence speed, combined with weight decay adjusted to 1e-05 for regularization. Maintaining the same optimizer (AdamW) along with the scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR) aims to keep consistency in the training strategy. Given the client's previous use of 2 local epochs is effective for medium-resource clients, we'll continue with that. A batch size of 32 allows them to maintain a manageable workload while ensuring reasonable gradient estimates. The dropout rate is kept at 0.25 to help prevent overfitting. On the server side, we switch the optimizer to SGD with a learning rate of 0.005 to control the additional complexity of the final layers. The momentum is set at 0.9, aligning with a commonly used value for SGD for better convergence. The scheduler is set to StepLR for a more adaptive learning rate adjustment as training progresses. The mu parameter is set at 0.01 to maintain a balance between the local model performance and global model learning.

The learning rate may be too low, and the batch size could be adjusted to improve training efficiency. Additionally, exploring a wider range of dropout rates may help with generalization. Therefore, I suggest increasing the learning rate for the client and experimenting with different values for batch size and dropout rate.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 13
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 13] ---
  - Reasoning: To improve the client's performance based on recent test accuracy and peer performance, several adjustments have been made to hyperparameters. The learning rate has been slightly reduced to 0.0005 to facilitate better convergence after observing the peer's performance with learning rates around this value. Weight decay is increased to 0.0001 to help with regularization, as past experiments have shown an improvement when clients used weight decay of this degree. Momentum is set to 0.9 based on previous successful configurations across peers, maintaining stability in the optimization process. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW' since it performed better compared to 'SGD' in prior epochs. The scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow smooth decay of the learning rate during training. Local epochs are maintained at 2 to ensure sufficient updates from local data, and the batch size is increased to 64 for better training efficiency, reflecting peer practices. Dropout rate is slightly adjusted to 0.25 to improve regularization based on the client's history. For the server, the learning rate is set to 0.005 to manage the complexity of the deeper layers effectively, matching prior successful configurations. Momentum remains at 0.9, yet again reflecting previous effective configurations. The server continues with the 'SGD' optimizer, which has been found effective for server-side computations in split federated learning, and follows with the 'StepLR' scheduler to facilitate periodic reductions in learning rate. Finally, the mu value is set to 0.01, aligned with both client and server's historical performance under the current framework, promoting stable convergence in the federated learning setup.

  - LLM Reasoning: The model's performance is relatively low with a final test accuracy of 61.66%. This indicates room for improvement in the hyperparameters. Specifically, I will reduce the client's learning rate to allow for finer tuning during training, and I will explore a higher dropout rate to potentially mitigate overfitting. Additionally, I will broaden the hyperparameter search space for batch size and consider a different optimizer for the server to assess overall performance.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 39
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 39] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this client is in a high-resource cluster (Cluster 2), it can afford larger batch sizes and more aggressive hyperparameters. For `learning_rate`, I suggest starting with `0.005`, which is suitable for a robust optimizer like AdamW while avoiding the risks of overshooting the optimum. The `weight_decay` is set to a moderate value of `0.0001`, which is beneficial to prevent overfitting without being too aggressive. A `momentum` of `0.9` is chosen, as it typically provides a good balance between convergence and training stability. The chosen optimizer is `AdamW`, because it performs well with high-dimensional data like CIFAR-10 and allows for better handling of learning rates dynamically. Since this is the first round, there's a higher risk of variance in learning, so using a `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler will help adapt the learning rate effectively over epochs. A `local_epochs` value of `2` is selected to allow the client sufficient training time to improve the model without being too lengthy. The `batch_size` is set to `128` to utilize the client's high capacity while ensuring effective gradient estimation. A `dropout_rate` of `0.2` is introduced to provide some regularization. 

On the server side, the learning rate is set to `0.0025`, which is a conservative choice to ensure that the updates from the client are well integrated into the deeper remaining layers. The `momentum` is also set to `0.9`, maintaining consistency with the client’s configuration. The `optimizer` chosen for the server is `SGD`, as it is generally more effective in scenarios where a less complex model is updated with certainty and stability. A `StepLR` scheduler helps in adjusting the learning rate at predetermined intervals, which can keep training steady as epochs progress.

For the `mu` value in FedProx regularization, I selected `0.01` to provide a moderate regulation effect to balance local accuracy from client updates with the server-side coherence.

Increasing the learning rate and batch size can accelerate training, while modifying the weight decay and dropout rate may help in regularization to prevent overfitting. Additionally, a more aggressive scheduler could further enhance performance.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 3
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 3] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 3 has high resources, I aimed to optimize performance while still considering peer results. I increased the learning rate to 0.003, which is higher than the initial learning rate of 0.002, based on the peer's success with a learning rate of 0.005. I also chose a slightly lower weight decay of 0.0003 to allow for more flexible model training, as higher weight decay may hinder learning. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain stability. I retained the 'AdamW' optimizer for its adaptive learning rate benefits and continued with 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the scheduler to fine-tune the learning process. Local epochs are set to 2 to maximize training time, and I opted to increase the batch size to 192, which is a balance between the available options, providing enough training examples per update while leveraging the high resource capacity of the client. I adjusted the dropout rate to 0.1, which promotes regularization while not overly dampening model complexity. 

For the server-side, I increased the server's learning rate to 0.005 to compensate for the split architecture and given the depth of the model. I maintained momentum at 0.9 to retain consistency with the client settings. The 'SGD' optimizer is chosen for its robustness in convergence, while 'StepLR' is utilized for schedulers, providing clean milestones in the training process.

Lastly, I kept the mu value at 0.01, as it has shown some degree of success for maintaining balance between the local and global models.

  - LLM Reasoning: The final test accuracy of 47.25% suggests room for improvement, indicating that the current hyperparameter settings may not be optimal. Given that the client can handle larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates, I propose increasing the client learning rate and batch size to explore potentially better performance. Additionally, I will decrease the weight decay to mitigate the effects of over-regularization.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 86
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 86] ---
  - Reasoning: The client has been consistently increasing its learning rate and batch size over previous epochs, which have resulted in improved accuracy. Given that Client 86 is a high-resource client, it is reasonable to continue this trend. I suggest increasing the learning rate to 0.006, which is at the upper limit of the search space, to maximize learning speed while maintaining stability. The batch size can also be increased to 512 since it fits well within the resource capabilities and aligns with previous successful configurations. A dropout rate of 0.2 is retained to help mitigate overfitting without overly restricting model capacity. The weight decay is set to 0.0005, a middle ground that has shown to work well in past epochs. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as it has been effective in achieving higher accuracy. The local epochs stay at 2 as prior uses have yielded improvement. For the server, I am adjusting the learning rate to slightly lower at 0.005 to reflect that a deeper model may become more sensitive to training rates. The optimizer will remain 'SGD' to keep consistency, while the momentum stays at 0.9 as the current peer clients have shown effectiveness with similar options. The server scheduler is set to 'StepLR' which allows for effective learning rate drops as iterations proceed. The value for mu is set to 0.01, as it has been consistently effective according to prior settings.

  - LLM Reasoning: The test accuracy of 36.03% indicates that the model is not learning effectively. Given the high-resource capabilities of the client and the ability to handle larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates, I will increase the learning rates for both the client and server while also raising the batch size for better generalization. Additionally, I suggest reducing the weight decay to allow for more exploration during training.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 50
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 50] ---
  - Reasoning: Client ID 50 is a high-resource client capable of handling larger batch sizes and a more aggressive learning rate. Given that it's the first round for this client, we should leverage insights from the peer history. For instance, Client 39 successfully achieved 54.38% accuracy with a learning rate of 0.005, local epochs set to 2, and a batch size of 128, while others saw lower performances with different parameters. Therefore, I recommend a slightly higher learning rate and batch size than those seen with successful peers, while considering the need for stability in the early rounds of training.

For the client-side hyperparameters, I'm proposing a learning rate of 0.006, weight decay of 0.0003 (to avoid overfitting), momentum at 0.9, using the AdamW optimizer for its adaptive nature, a CosineAnnealingLR scheduler for learning rate adjustment, 2 local epochs to leverage training without overfitting, a batch size of 256 (optimal for high-res clients), and a dropout rate of 0.1 for regularization.

On the server-side, since the client is handling the initial layers, a modest learning rate of 0.005 will help keep the training stable as the server processes the more complex final layer of the model. Applying SGD with a momentum of 0.9 will balance the simplicity and efficiency needed for convergence. The StepLR scheduler will aid in learning rate adjustments over time. Finally, I chose mu at 0.01 for FedProx to provide a reasonable degree of regularization, leveraging the existing peer's settings which were effective.

In summary, the hyperparameter selection focuses on optimizing client performance while ensuring server-side compatibility, balancing between exploration of hyperparameters and maintaining a level of stability in this first training round.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 24
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 24] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 24 belongs to a low-resource cluster, the hyperparameters must be carefully selected to ensure stable training without overwhelming the client's limited capacity. Starting with the `learning_rate`, I've chosen `0.001`, which is a moderate value that allows for gradual weight updates without risking instability. For `weight_decay`, a small value of `5e-05` has been selected to prevent overfitting while still being gentle due to resource constraints. The `momentum` is set to `0.9`, providing a balance that could help in faster convergence during training without being too aggressive. The `optimizer` chosen is `SGD`, as it is generally more suitable for clients with limited resources compared to `AdamW`, which may consume more computational resources. Using `CosineAnnealingLR` as the `scheduler` encourages learning rate adaptation, which could be helpful in stabilizing the training process. Given the client's resource limitations, `local_epochs` is limited to `1`, allowing for quicker feedback without overburdening the client during the first round. The `batch_size` is set to `16`, which is one of the smallest available options and is crucial for low-resource identification tasks. Finally, a `dropout_rate` of `0.1` is introduced to help prevent overfitting, while still keeping it at a manageable level for this client's capacity.

On the server-side, the learning rate is set to `0.003`, which falls under the moderate range suitable for deeper models, allowing gradients to be updated with a careful but effective approach since the server handles more complex calculations. A `momentum` of `0.9` again is selected to assist with convergence speed. The optimizer remains as `SGD` to retain uniformity in the strategy since it works well together with the client’s choices. The scheduler is `None`, as this might be a beneficial setting when working with a deeper server model during the initial epochs. Lastly, for `mu`, a value of `0.005` is chosen to balance the level of regularization from the FedProx term; this provides stability in the face of potential variations in client updates, particularly given the resource constraints.

All choices were made considering the client's performance limitations and the slightly deeper architecture on the server-side, ensuring an effective federated learning process.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 95] ---
  - Reasoning: Considering the client's low-resource capacity, I've opted for hyperparameters that ensure stable training while potentially improving model accuracy. The learning rate is set to 0.0005 to allow for gradual convergence without overshooting minimums, which is crucial for lower capacity clients. The weight decay is chosen as 1e-06 to prevent overfitting while remaining within the available range. Momentum is set to 0.9, which is a standard choice that can facilitate better learning dynamics. I've selected 'SGD' as the optimizer based on consistency in the client's performance with SGD in previous epochs, combined with the success of peers using this optimizer as well. A 'None' scheduler is used since low-frequency updates may not yield benefits for low-resource clients at this stage. Local epochs are set to 1 to restrict training compute requirements, while the batch size is set to a smaller value of 16, which aligns with the observed needs of low-resource clients. The dropout rate is kept at 0.2, reflecting previous successful configurations that manage overfitting without hampering learning. For the server, I chose a learning rate of 0.002 to complement the average learning rate in the scaling context of the overall split architecture. I maintained momentum at 0.9 and used 'SGD' for consistency with the client's optimizer. 'None' is selected as the scheduler since it aligns with the current approach. Finally, mu is set to 0.01 to balance the regularization effect of FedProx, encouraging convergence while mitigating variance from clients.

A smaller batch size may improve stability during training, and lowering the learning rate could further help in fine-tuning the model. Additionally, since the client is a low-resource one, adjusting the dropout rate could prevent overfitting while using fewer resources.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 68
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 68] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the low-resource status of Client 68, adjustments are needed to optimize training stability and performance. The historical data indicates that a learning rate of 0.001 has been previously successful for the client, while the peer history shows some success with a lower weight decay of 5e-05. Hence, it is advisable to maintain a learning rate of 0.001 but to set the weight decay to 5e-05 for better regularization. The momentum remains effective at 0.9, and since the optimizer used has also shown good results in this environment, SGD is retained. The scheduler option is chosen as 'None' for this client as it has previously struggled with the complexity of cosine annealing, and keeping local epochs at 1 preserves the client's limited computational capacity. The batch size is set to a low value of 16, reflecting the client’s low resource status. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 is retained to help with regularization, pairing well with the chosen training approach. On the server side, following the low-resource paradigms, a learning rate of 0.001 will assist in fine-tuning without overwhelming the model's capacity. Momentum remains at 0.9, using SGD for consistency with the client's optimizer. The scheduler remains 'StepLR' to introduce periodic learning rate decay and aid in convergence. The value of 'mu' is set at 0.01, balancing regularization without discouraging collaboration between the client and server layers.

  Client 68, Local Epochs 1: Train Acc 86.81%, Test Acc 59.70%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 23
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 23] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that Client 23 is a low-resource client and this is its first communication round, we need to choose hyperparameters that ensure stable and effective training while being mindful of resource constraints. The peer history shows that both Client 24 and Client 68 utilized a learning rate around 0.0005 to 0.001 and achieved reasonable performance (60.63% and 57.55% accuracy, respectively). Therefore, I will select a learning rate of 0.001, which is mid-range, allowing for a balance between learning speed and stability. The weight decay should be set to 5e-05 to prevent overfitting in a low-resource setting, as suggested by previous clients. Since all peers used SGD as their optimizer with momentum set to 0.9, I will choose SGD for consistency and reliability in certain scenarios, particularly at lower resource capacities. A local epoch of 1 is appropriate for this round since it allows the model to update frequently without overwhelming the client and will also align with the fact that this is a first communication round. A batch size of 16 is suitable given the low resource capabilities to ensure that the client can handle the data effectively. The dropout rate will be set to 0.1 to encourage robustness without over-regularizing. The FedProx regularization term, mu, will be set at 0.005, based on the feedback from peers, allowing some control over the divergence of client updates while being judicious. For the server, following the complexity introduced by the deeper model, I will set the server learning rate to 0.003, as it is slightly higher than the client's, which is common practice to help the server learn more aggressively while still maintaining convergence. I will stick with the SGD optimizer and apply the 'None' scheduler since the task doesn't indicate a necessity for learning rate adjustments within the server.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 15
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 15] ---
  - Reasoning: The chosen hyperparameters for the client aim to balance performance and resource constraints in a medium-capacity environment. For the `learning_rate`, I suggest using `0.0005` since reducing the learning rate slightly from the previous `0.001` may help achieve a better convergence without overfitting in a moderate-resource setup. The `weight_decay` is set to `0.0001` to regularize the model and prevent overfitting; this value is within the recommended range and can control model complexity effectively. The `momentum` is retained at `0.9`, which is a strong choice for both AdamW and SGD optimizers, promoting faster convergence by helping the optimizer escape local minima. I've chosen `AdamW` as the optimizer since it works well for deep learning tasks and is generally more adaptive compared to SGD. The `scheduler` is kept as `CosineAnnealingLR` as it has shown potential in adapting the learning rate throughout training effectively. Keeping `local_epochs` at `2` ensures sufficient training on the client's local data without overwhelming resource limitations. For `batch_size`, I've opted for `32`, which is a balance between efficient training and memory usage. The `dropout_rate` is retained at `0.2` to help reduce overfitting, particularly important when working with small datasets like CIFAR-10.

On the server side, considering it handles more complex layers, I suggest a higher `learning_rate` of `0.001`, which can enhance the server's learning performance. The `momentum` is set to `0.9`, similar to the client, promoting good movement in optimization. The `optimizer` is chosen as `SGD` to provide a more straightforward learning approach that can benefit from the proper learning adjustments. The `scheduler` is set to `CosineAnnealingLR`, ensuring consistent adaptive learning adjustments over training.

For the `mu` parameter of FedProx, a value of `0.01` is chosen as it supports balancing local and global training objectives, thus ensuring stability in the federated learning process.

  Client 15, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 93.19%, Test Acc 66.76%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 92
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 92] ---
  - Reasoning: In this first round for Client 92, I selected hyperparameters based on the client capacity and peer history. Given that the client is in the medium-resource category, I opted for a moderate `learning_rate` of 0.001 and a `weight_decay` of 0.0001 to balance training speed and regularization, which is especially important for CIFAR-10 with ResNet18. The `momentum` is set to 0.9, aligned with common values in practice, which can help with convergence. The `optimizer` is chosen as 'AdamW', which tends to handle sparse gradients better than SGD, especially in vision tasks. The `scheduler` will be 'CosineAnnealingLR', as it allows the learning rate to adapt dynamically over epochs, which is useful in federated learning to manage the learning process effectively. For `local_epochs`, 2 epochs are selected to allow for sufficient training on the client's local data despite the moderate resources. A `batch_size` of 32 is chosen as a balance between computational efficiency and memory constraints. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2 to prevent overfitting without overly sacrificing representational capacity. For the server, I specified a `learning_rate` of 0.005, which is higher than the client's to account for the complexity of the remaining layers and the adjustment in weights from the clients. I selected the same `momentum` of 0.9 for consistency and stability in updates. The optimizer is again 'SGD', which is standard for server updates, optimized for convergence in federated settings. A `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler is selected as well to maintain coherence with the client's approach. The `mu` value is set to 0.01 based on Client 15's performance, allowing for some proximity regularization while still encouraging model participation, making it a reasonable choice for the context.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 27
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 27] ---
  - Reasoning: To optimize the training process for Client 27 using the SplitFed framework with FedProx regularization, the hyperparameters were selected with careful consideration of previous performance, peer comparisons, and resource constraints. The learning rate for the client is set at 0.00035, similar to its previous setting, which led to satisfactory accuracy, while also taking cues from Client 15's settings that proved more effective with a slightly higher learning rate of 0.0005, suggesting that the medium resource nature of the client can accommodate this increase. The weight decay is kept at 0.0001 because it balances the generalization capabilities without causing excessive underfitting, as indicated by the past records. The momentum is set to 0.9, aligning with typical values seen in successful implementations and previous results for the client. The optimizer is chosen as 'AdamW' to leverage its adaptive learning rate properties and is consistent with the client's historical choice, while the scheduler remains as 'CosineAnnealingLR', fitting the training style experienced. Local epochs are kept at 2 to ensure that the client can afford more passes on its local data without straining its resources, and the batch size is reduced to 16, which is manageable and facilitates learning without overwhelming the medium-resource capacity. The dropout rate is set to 0.2, empathetic to the client's previous experiences and promoting regularization without hampering model training.

On the server-side, the learning rate is increased to 0.005, higher than the client's because it runs deeper network layers that may require a more aggressive training approach, thereby increasing convergence speed. An optimizer of 'SGD' is chosen for its robustness in training deeper models effectively. The CosineAnnealingLR is maintained for the scheduler as it has shown promise in prior iterations, which fits the server's need for adaptability across training. The mu is set at 0.02, a balance that enhances model generalization while still allowing flexibility for FedProx regularization to efficiently mitigate discrepancies in the models.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 40
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 40] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the context provided for client ID 40 in Cluster 2, I have selected hyperparameters to optimize their performance in the SplitFed setting. The client is high-resource and can afford to use larger batch sizes and aggressive learning rates. For the client-side settings, a learning rate of 0.005 provides a good balance between convergence speed and stability. I chose an `AdamW` optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 to help maintain updates direction efficiently. The batch size of 64 is suitable for a powerful client, allowing for effective use of resources while managing memory. I set the local epochs to 2 for more robust local training in the first round since this client has no prior history, and a dropout rate of 0.2 aids in generalizing the model without overfitting. A weight decay of 1e-04 helps counteract overfitting while keeping it minimal. For the server-side settings, I opted for a learning rate of 0.001 with an SGD optimizer, as the server handles a generally deeper model architecture. A momentum of 0.9 helps enhance convergence. The scheduler used is `CosineAnnealingLR` to gradually adjust the learning rate, optimizing the learning process over epochs. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 balances the local and global objectives while considering the additional regularization that FedProx introduces.

  - LLM Reasoning: The current test accuracy of 39.04% suggests that the model is not performing well and may benefit from further tuning of hyperparameters. Given that the client is a high-resource setup, we can explore larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates. Additionally, given the dropout rate of 0.2 and moderate weight decay, we might consider adjusting these for more regularization or exploration of model capacity.

  Client 40, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 79.04%, Test Acc 37.89%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 97
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 97] ---
  - Reasoning: Given that this is the first training round for client 97, leveraging the insights from client 40 who achieved a reasonable accuracy with specific hyperparameters is crucial. This client belongs to Cluster 2, indicating they can handle more substantial configurations. Therefore, after careful consideration of the historical performance as well as the client's capabilities, here are the selected hyperparameters: 

- **Learning Rate**: Set at **0.005**, reflecting a slightly higher learning rate than client 40 to allow for more aggressive convergence given the client's high-resource capacity.
- **Weight Decay**: Adjusted to **0.0001** to prevent overfitting while maintaining the ability to capture significant feature representations from the dataset.
- **Momentum**: Chosen at **0.9** aligns with the optimizer used in client 40, which helps in accelerating the gradients vectors in the right directions.
- **Optimizer**: The choice of **AdamW** allows for efficient handling of the learning process, which is preferred over SGD in many scenarios due to its adaptive learning capabilities, especially with image datasets like CIFAR10.
- **Scheduler**: Using **CosineAnnealingLR** to adjust the learning rate dynamically over epochs enhances the training stability and generalization of the model over time.
- **Local Epochs**: Maintained at **2** since increasing the local epochs can allow the model to learn more adequately from the local data before sending updates to the server.
- **Batch Size**: Set to **64**, which balances memory requirements with sufficient frequency of weight updates.
- **Dropout Rate**: Selected to be **0.2** to introduce regularization, hence improving the model's ability to generalize and combat overfitting.

On the server side, the learning rate is set to **0.001**, lower than the client's learning rate to ensure more stable updates from the server combined with an **SGD optimizer** for fine-tuning, and maintaining **0.9 momentum** for effective convergence. The **CosineAnnealingLR** scheduler ensures that server-side learning rates have a decay mechanism similar to that on the client side, which helps both parts of the model remain aligned in progression. Lastly, the **mu** parameter is set to **0.01**, balancing the FedProx regularization to allow appropriate trade-offs between local and global objectives where this level seems optimal given the client's initial conditions.

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 88
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 88] ---
  - Reasoning: To enhance the client's performance after observing their past results and peer performances, I have selected hyperparameters that strike a balance between aggression and stability. Given that the client is high-resource, the batch size has been increased to 256 to leverage more data per update, improving convergence speed. I opted to maintain a learning rate of 0.005, as both the client and peers have shown reasonable success at this rate. Additionally, the dropout rate is increased to 0.4 to mitigate overfitting due to the complexity of ResNet18 when trained over a richer dataset like CIFAR-10. For weight decay, I selected a value of 0.0005 which is within the effective range of 1e-06 to 0.001. Local epochs remain at 2 for effective local training while keeping updates frequent. I kept the existing optimizer `AdamW` and the scheduler `CosineAnnealingLR`, which has shown adaptability during training. On the server-side, a learning rate of 0.002 is selected to accommodate the complexity of the remaining layer while still being synchronized with the client. The `AdamW` optimizer is also preferred for the server due to its stability and performance benefits in deep networks. A `StepLR` scheduler is chosen to manage the learning rate, allowing decay at set intervals. mu is kept at 0.01 to balance the influence of the regularization term on the federated learning framework.

Given the high resource availability of the client, we can increase the learning rate for both the client and server, as well as explore larger batch sizes to increase training efficiency. Additionally, we will try reducing the dropout rate, as a lower rate might help improve the capacity of the model to learn meaningful features from the data.

  - Reasoning: Given the context of this low-resource client and the previous hyperparameter settings, I've made adjustments to optimize performance while ensuring stability. The learning rate is kept at 0.0005, which is on the high end of the available search space but suitable for low-resource clients if paired with appropriate optimizers and settings. The weight decay is set to 0.0001 to introduce modest regularization without overwhelming the learning process. Momentum is kept at 0.9, which is effective for SGD without being overly aggressive. I chose the 'SGD' optimizer given its stability in low-resource settings compared to 'AdamW' under similar conditions. The dropout rate remains at 0.2, which strikes a balance between avoiding overfitting and maintaining model capacity. A batch size of 16 is retained to accommodate the limitations of the client and potentially enhance convergence stability. I've increased the local epochs to 2, allowing for more updates to the model while still working within the client's capacity constraints. The server-side retains a learning rate of 0.001 for simplicity and effective training alongside the split architecture, using 'SGD' for consistency with the client. The scheduler is set to 'None' as the model training is already conservative with learning, and the mu value is set at 0.01, aligning it with common practice in federated learning scenarios to control the FedProx regularization effect.

  - Reasoning: Given the client's moderate capacity and previous results, we want to fine-tune the hyperparameters to improve the accuracy. For the client side:
- **Learning Rate**: Starting with 0.001 is a good practice since a smaller value can help learning gradually, especially since the client did not achieve high accuracy in the last epoch. 
- **Weight Decay**: Keeping it at 0.0001 can help regularize the model without being too restrictive, given the dropout rate.
- **Momentum**: A momentum of 0.9 is commonly effective in helping accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions during optimization.
- **Optimizer**: 'AdamW' is preferred because it generally performs well on deep learning tasks, particularly with the feature richness of ResNet architectures.
- **Scheduler**: 'CosineAnnealingLR' can be beneficial in adjusting the learning rate dynamically over time, which may allow for better convergence over local epochs.
- **Local Epochs**: Increase to 2 local epochs to allow more training on the client data, which might enhance local model improvements.
- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 32 is a balanced choice for a medium-resource client, as it allows for stable gradients without consuming too much memory.
- **Dropout Rate**: Set at 0.2 to help prevent overfitting given the model's complexity. 

On the server side:
- **Learning Rate**: Set to 0.0005, which is suitable for fine-tuning in a more complex model architecture and aligns with the client's learning rate.
- **Momentum**: Maintain at 0.9 as server models typically benefit from similar momentum settings.
- **Optimizer**: 'SGD' should be effective here, especially for server models where we often prioritize stability and convergence.
- **Scheduler**: Utilize 'StepLR' as it allows adjusting the learning rate by predetermined steps, useful for server side stability, especially due to server model complexity.

**Mu**: Set to 0.01 as it strikes a good balance between standard training and federated learning challenges, preventing overfit while still allowing the server to influence the client updates effectively.

  Client 14, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 94.11%, Test Acc 72.46%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 34
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 34] ---
  - Reasoning: In selecting hyperparameters for client 34 in the Split Federated Learning scheme, the choices consider the client's medium resource capacity, the current state of client 14, and the available search space. Given that this is the client's first training round, starting conservatively within recommended ranges is advisable.

1. **Learning Rate:** A learning rate of **0.001** is selected as it is a middle-ground between the min (0.0001) and max (0.01). Client 14 used a learning rate of 0.0005, which did provide reasonable performance (71.32% accuracy), so 0.001 may be optimal for improved learning without being too aggressive.

2. **Weight Decay:** A weight decay of **0.0001** is chosen, as it is commonly used to prevent overfitting. It's also in the lower range of the search space, allowing some regularization without being too restrictive.

3. **Momentum:** Setting momentum to **0.9** helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging while staying stable. It matches client 14's choice.

4. **Optimizer:** **AdamW** is selected over SGD since it combines the adaptive capability of Adam with weight decay, which can be beneficial with small datasets like CIFAR-10.

5. **Scheduler:** **CosineAnnealingLR** is preferred to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. This scheduler can help the training converge better and avoid local minima, as seen in recent practices.

6. **Local Epochs:** Setting local epochs to **2** allows for sufficient training on this client's data without overburdening the medium-resource setup, providing a balance between convergence speed and resource usage.

7. **Batch Size:** A batch size of **32** is chosen as a moderate value appropriate for a medium-resource client. It was the same as used by client 14, ensuring comparability in workload.

8. **Dropout Rate:** A dropout rate of **0.2** is specified to introduce regularization and combat overfitting, which aligns with common practices for architectures like ResNet-18.

For the server hyperparameters, a learning rate of **0.005** is suggested to accommodate the complexity of the model it runs, slightly higher than the client's to maintain a balance in learning dynamics. Momentum remains at **0.9** for stability, and **SGD** is chosen because of its efficacy in larger models. The cooling strategy of **StepLR** is adopted to decrease the learning rate periodically, safeguarding against overshoot in convergence.

Finally, **mu** is set to **0.01**, reflecting a moderate level of FedProx regularization, which should help balance the local client updates with global consistency in the federated context.

  Client 34, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 91.11%, Test Acc 57.58%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 7
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 7] ---
  - Reasoning: The choices for the hyperparameters were made based on the performance history of the client and peer clients. The client previously achieved 49.83% accuracy with a learning rate of 0.001, but peers with lower learning rates (0.0005) had significantly higher accuracies (71.32% for Client 14). Therefore, we will reduce the learning rate to 0.0005. The weight decay was set to a more conservative value of 0.0001, which has shown promise in the peer history without negatively impacting performance. Given that Client 14 had a dropout rate of 0.2, we also adopt this to mitigate overfitting while accommodating medium-resource constraints. The optimizer remains AdamW since it provides better performance at lower learning rates, and we continue with the same local epochs and batch size due to the medium resource classification. For the server-side, we'll choose a learning rate of 0.001 to align with the complexity of the latter layers in ResNet18, combined with SGD as it is robust for this kind of task. A moderate momentum of 0.9 helps in maintaining stability during training. We will use the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler to allow adaptive learning adjustments over time. Keeping mu at 0.01 provides a good level of proxy regularization without overwhelming the model adaptation. Thus, the selected hyperparameters are expected to facilitate better convergence and overall performance.

  Client 7, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 90.09%, Test Acc 63.87%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 21
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 21] ---
  - Reasoning: For Client ID 21, operating under moderate resource constraints, I've selected hyperparameters that balance performance with the client's capacity. The learning rate is set to 0.001 as it is commonly effective for initial training, especially for medium-resource clients. A weight decay of 0.0001 is chosen to regularize the model without being overly restrictive. A momentum of 0.9 leverages previous gradients efficiently without being too aggressive. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW', which is generally more effective for training deep learning models, especially under federated learning settings. A batch size of 32 is chosen as this is a compromise between efficient computation and memory usage. I've selected 2 local epochs since initial training could benefit from more updates without overstretching resources. A dropout rate of 0.2 helps prevent overfitting while being moderate enough for this task. For the server-side, 'SGD' is chosen as it can facilitate better convergence for larger models like ResNet18, with a learning rate of 0.005 to account for the higher layer complexities. The server will also use 'StepLR' to adjust the learning rate over time, enhancing training stability. Lastly, 'mu' is kept at 0.01, as it has been effective in the peer's runs and keeps the regularization in check without overly dampening gradient updates.

Given the high-resource capacity of the client, we can increase the batch size and learning rate and adjust the dropout rate for better model training. Additionally, I will explore a range of values for the learning rate and batch size to fully explore their effects.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 28] ---
  - Reasoning: Based on the historical performance and capabilities of Client ID 28, I've revised the hyperparameters to further optimize the training process. During previous epochs, the client showed improved accuracy when using a `learning_rate` of 0.005, so I have chosen to retain that value but will also test a slightly higher `batch_size` to leverage its high-resource capabilities. The `local_epochs` is set to 2 to allow for more comprehensive training on the local data. Given the peer's high accuracy and similar hyperparameters, I aimed for consistency while slightly increasing `weight_decay` to see if that helps in regularizing the model further. I have chosen `AdamW` as the optimizer since it's shown good results and set a `dropout_rate` of 0.2, aligned with peer's performance. For the server side, I selected `SGD` as the optimizer, and a `learning_rate` of 0.003 based on recent performance and the deeper model complexity. The `scheduler` is set to `StepLR` to allow for a structured learning rate decay, which could help stabilize performance during training. Finally, I've retained the `mu` at 0.01, which has been effective at controlling the FedProx regularization process in prior implementations.

  Client 28, Local Epochs 2: Train Acc 79.28%, Test Acc 44.64%

>>> Graph Node: SUGGEST for Client 19
--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 19] ---
  - Reasoning: Given the high-resource capabilities of Client 19, larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates can be leveraged for better convergence. The previous settings yielded a test accuracy of 31.57%, which signifies potential for improvement, especially after seeing peers achieve higher accuracies with refined hyperparameters. I propose increasing the `learning_rate` slightly to 0.006, which balances aggressive learning without becoming unstable. `Weight_decay` is adjusted to 0.00015 to maintain regularization while promoting effective learning. I suggest keeping `momentum` at 0.9, given that it's already performing well. For the `optimizer`, 'AdamW' is recommended due to its adaptive learning rate properties, which suits varying model complexities well. The `scheduler` remains as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to implement a smooth learning rate decay throughout epochs, as seen in peer examples. Increasing `local_epochs` to 2 can enhance model learning at the client level, and a `batch_size` of 128 is also kept for efficiency. Finally, a `dropout_rate` of 0.35 is suggested to further generalize the model without overfitting based on the current performance.

On the server side, given it's running the final layer, I recommend a  `learning_rate` of 0.003 to ensure effective learning through the denser network layers. Retaining `momentum` at 0.9 helps maintain stable updates. The `optimizer` should also be 'SGD' as using it in conjunction with the server setup aligns with typical practices observed in federated scenarios. I propose a simple `scheduler` set to 'StepLR' to adjust the learning rate in a more predictable manner at the server level. Finally, I maintain `mu` at 0.01 for the FedProx regularization, as it establishes a balance without overly penalizing deviations from the client model. Overall, these selected hyperparameters should improve efficiency and model performance on client 19.

--- [HP Agent Verdict for Client 18] ---
  - Reasoning: 1. **Learning Rate:** I recommend setting the client's learning_rate to 0.005. This is balanced between the peers who achieved higher accuracies (0.005 used by client 28) given that the client has high computational capacity and can handle slightly more aggressive learning rates. 2. **Weight Decay:** Set to 0.0002 as it was used by client 28 with higher accuracy, which suggests optimal regularization without being excessive for the given model. 3. **Momentum:** Kept at 0.9 to maintain consistency with successful trials and to ensure adequate momentum in the optimization process. 4. **Optimizer:** I suggest using 'AdamW' since it has shown effectiveness in previous peer trials, including client 28 and myself. 5. **Scheduler:** Keeping 'CosineAnnealingLR' aligns with the successful optimizers utilized to maintain a dynamic learning rate throughout training, thus improving convergence. 6. **Local Epochs:** Set to 2 since it's the maximum, allowing more updates per data slice which is beneficial for convergence given the model complexity. 7. **Batch Size:** Set to 128 as it was successfully utilized before, ensuring efficient memory use while promoting stable gradient estimates. 8. **Dropout Rate:** Set to 0.2 which balances between regularization and retaining model capacity based on previous client trials. 9. **Server Learning Rate:** Choose 0.003 based on peer inputs; slightly higher than the previous server rate to compensate for high model complexity at the server. 10. **Server Optimizer and Momentum:** Utilize SGD with momentum set at 0.9, as it’s widely effective for server-side updates of neural networks like ResNet and is consistent across multiple successful peers. 11. **Server Scheduler:** 'StepLR' is chosen to allow periodic reduction of the learning rate, which can be beneficial given the model layers' complexity. 12. **Mu:** Set to 0.01, as consistency with the current rounds across clients indicates this value maintains stability in the federated learning setup.
